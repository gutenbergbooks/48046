<h2>PREFACE TO VOLUMES XXVIII-XXIX</h2>


<p>With these two volumes our series returns to Oregon, and
to the question already shadowed forth upon the horizon,
whether this vast territory drained by the Columbia River
should belong to the United States or to Great Britain.
Since the treaty of joint occupancy (1818) the English fur-traders
had been in almost exclusive control. From the
upper waters of the great rivers that drain the Arctic plains
they had pushed their way across the Rockies down into
the fertile southern valleys, and had explored, mapped, and
threaded the entire region lying between Spanish territory
on the south and Russian on the north. Between the
great mountain barrier on the east, and the Pacific on the
west, they held the country as a vast preserve in which fur-bearing
animals might be reared and hunted. For many
years the American right to joint occupancy lay in abeyance.
After his thrilling journey of exploration and adventure,
Jedediah S. Smith was cordially received at Fort Vancouver
(1828), his injuries by predatory Indians avenged, and
his furs purchased by the company's factor; in return for
this courtesy, however, he considered himself in honor
bound to restrict the further trapping enterprises of his firm
to the eastern side of the Rocky Mountains. When Captain
Bonneville, with his band of trappers, reached the forts on
the upper Columbia (1833) he was courteously but firmly
refused the privilege of trading at posts of the Hudson's
Bay Company. Thus, fifteen years after joint occupancy
had been arranged, there was scarcely an American in
Oregon.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span></p>

<p>In our volume xxi we traced the rise and fall of the trading
adventures to this far Western territory of Captain
Nathaniel Wyeth of Massachusetts. His two expeditions
left on the Willamette River a small residuum of New Englanders,
and before his departure he had seen the coming
of the first American missionaries, pioneers then as now in
advancing American interests. The existence of Oregon
had now come to be known to a considerable body of our
people, its fertility and beauty had been enlarged upon by
several writers, its advantages pictured, and its possession
desired.</p>

<p>In returning to the United States, one of the missionaries,
Jason Lee, undertook a tour through the border states of
the West, lecturing and raising funds for his work. In
the autumn of 1838 he stopped at the Illinois town of
Peoria, where his glowing descriptions of the land whence
he came produced an impression sufficiently lasting to
result in the organization of an emigration society, which
prepared to set forth for this land of promise early the following
spring. Among the band was a young Vermont
lawyer, Thomas Jefferson Farnham, who a few years earlier
had removed to Illinois, and who now sought on the
Western prairies recuperation of his wasting health through
outdoor exploits and change of scene. He also avowed a
patriotic purpose to take possession of this fair territory of
Oregon for the American flag, and to aid in resisting the
British fur-trade monopoly. His address and eloquence
won him the honor of being chosen captain of the small
band of nineteen adventurers, none of whom knew aught
of wilderness life or was prepared to endure the hardships of
the proposed journey.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the serious purpose expressed in the
motto worked by Mrs. Farnham upon the flag of the little
company&mdash;"Oregon or the Grave"&mdash;they set forth in a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
holiday mood, ill-equipped for traversing the vast and
rugged spaces lying between Illinois and the Pacific Slope.
Each member of the "Oregon Dragoons," as they styled
themselves, was expected to furnish $160 in money to serve
for outfit and provisions.</p>

<p>The thirtieth of May, 1839, found them leaving Independence,
on the western border of Missouri, provided with
"bacon and flour, salt and pepper sufficient for four hundred
miles," as well as the necessary arms and ammunition
carefully packed on horses and mules. By the advice of
two experienced fur-traders returning from the mountains,
the travellers determined upon the Santa F&eacute; trail, probably
because of the escort privileges in connection with the annual
caravan just setting forth. Therein they made a serious
mistake, for the route across the mountains from the upper
Arkansas to Snake River valley was infinitely more difficult
and dangerous than the ordinary Oregon Trail, by way of
the North Platte, Sweetwater, and South Pass; it was also
less frequented by experienced mountain men, who could
offer advice and assistance to the amateur travellers.
Moreover the usual seeds of dissension and dissatisfaction
had already been sown in the little party, each blaming
others for the hardships and trials already experienced.
Some of Farnham's followers pronounced the leader
incompetent. Several deserted at the Lower Crossing of
the Arkansas, preferring to follow the caravan to Santa F&eacute;;
while at Bent's Fort, on the upper trail, the remainder of
the party left their leader with but four companions, one
of these a man who had been accidentally wounded in
crossing the plains. Of the "mutineers," who crossed to
Fort St. Vrain, above Denver, the majority arrived in Oregon
that or the following year.</p>

<p>Farnham, however, having secured a competent guide,
with undiminished energy pushed on across the ranges of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
the Colorado mountains, through the mazes of its parks and
passes, and halted awhile at Brown's Hole. This was the
most difficult part of the journey. With graphic touches
our author makes us feel the hardships, hunger and thirst,
the Indian alarms, and the surprise and joy of meeting
mountain men; while at the same time he is not oblivious
to the rugged grandeur of the scenery, or the delicate tints
of sunrise and sunset, and the majesty of the starlit nights
among the hills. At Fort David Crockett, in Brown's Hole,
two more of Farnham's comrades turned back, discouraged
by the gloomy prospects, and the disheartening accounts of
Oregon furnished by a returning guide. Here also Kelly,
the unerring scout, was to leave the party, now consisting of
but three travellers, who were under the necessity of trusting
to the guidance of Shoshoni Indian "Jim" as far as the hospitable
gates of Fort Hall. Here, the Shoshoni guide was
exchanged for a Wallawalla, who contracted to conduct
the party across the arid wastes of Snake River valley, halting
briefly at Fort Boise, and leading the way over the Blue
Mountains to the valley of the Wallawalla and the upper
Columbia. There meeting a Christian Cayuse on his way
to Dr. Whitman's mission at Waiilatpu, Farnham turned
aside for a brief rest at this hospitable station, whose
owners were "desirous to ask me how long a balloon line
had been running between the States and the Pacific."
Resting a few days under their mission roof, Farnham
gives a favorable report of the activities and the success of
the missionaries. Passing on his way by Fort Wallawalla
down the Columbia to the Hudson's Bay Company's
headquarters at Fort Vancouver, he there received the
customary courtesy extended to all travellers in that
distant region, this account closing our volume xxviii.</p>

<p>Three weeks' recuperation from the hardships of the four
months of difficult journeying refreshed our traveller suffi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>ciently
to set him forth on an exploration of the settled portions
of the country. He visited the Willamette valley, where
he met the Methodist missionaries, and his presence
furnished the opportunity to discuss the desirability of
American occupation. A petition was thereupon set
on foot, of which Farnham was undoubtedly the author,
signed by seventy settlers of the valley, praying the United
States to take them under its protection and describing
the country as "one of the most favored portions of
the globe." The language of the petition being much
more favorable to Oregon than Farnham's later writings,
these latter caused some acrimony among his Willamette
hosts, one of whom told Commodore Wilkes, the following
year, that a few days before Farnham left his party were
lost in the woods and obliged to pass a cold and dark night,
standing up to their ankles in mire, which cured the visitor
of his enthusiasm for the country.<a name="FNanchor_1" id="FNanchor_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> Certain it is that Farnham
wrote from the Sandwich Islands early in January,
1840, that everything in the Oregon country had been much
overrated except the seat of the Methodist mission.<a name="FNanchor_2" id="FNanchor_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<p>Whatever may have been the cause of Farnham's change
of heart, after a brief sojourn, he left Oregon on the Hudson's
Bay Company's vessel bound for Hawaii. Thence
he took passage for the coast of California, where he arrived
at Monterey during one of those tempestuous revolutions
to which Latin-American governments are subject. A
number of American residents had been imprisoned by the
successful revolutionists on charge of complicity with the
losing party. According to Farnham's own account,<a name="FNanchor_3" id="FNanchor_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> given
in somewhat grandiloquent style, it was largely due to his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>efforts that the lives of the Americans were saved, and that
they were shipped on transports to Mexico for trial. Lingering
a few days longer to enjoy a fiesta on the seashore near
Monterey, and to visit the neighboring Carmelo mission, our
traveller embarked for Santa Barbara, finally arriving at
San Blas on the sixteenth of May, 1840. Thence he undertook
a hurried journey across Mexico and through its gulf
to New Orleans, which brought him once more to the
confines of his native land. He now "ascended the
Father of Waters to the holy and blooming plains of my
Prairie Home&mdash;to wife&mdash;and the graves of those I loved
among the trees at Prairie Lodge."</p>

<p>The remainder of Farnham's life was passed in literary
labors, and in travels throughout the United States in search
of health. In 1841 he was in New York City. At one
time the family moved to Wisconsin for a brief period, but
soon settled in the neighborhood of Alton, Illinois. About
1846 Farnham returned to California, where he died at San
Francisco in September, 1848. His wife, Eliza Woodson
Farnham, acquired some reputation as an author and philanthropist.
She successfully attempted prison reform
among the women inmates at Sing Sing, for a time assisted
Dr. Howe in the Massachusetts Institute for the Blind, and
revisited California, of whose early days she wrote entertainingly.</p>

<p>No doubt Farnham's books did much to awaken interest
in the Western country, and to call attention to its possibilities.
Written in an easy, attractive style, although
somewhat garrulous in tone and inclined to speculative
digressions, they were in their day popular works and ran
through several editions, being widely read in the Eastern
and Middle States.<a name="FNanchor_4" id="FNanchor_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> Their interest for our present series
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>lies chiefly in the description of the journey across the plains,
by a route differing much from those of other travellers.
Farnham's descriptions are detailed and well phrased.
The first after Pike to thread the passes of the upper
Arkansas, he vividly portrays the Colorado mountain valleys,
streams, and ranges, the grandeur and nobility of the
views, and the fertility of the great parks, and makes his
readers realize the hardy endurance needed for such
mountain journeyings in that early day. Encounters with
Indians were rare in these regions, but occasional meetings
with solitary trappers add a human interest to the picture
of the wilderness. The life of these mountain men&mdash;their
Indian families, their poverty, generosity, recklessness,
and almost passionate attachment for the wild life
that claimed them&mdash;Farnham describes with a sympathetic
touch. He also gathered information at first hand
concerning the Indians of the region, the status of the
fur-trade, and the far-reaching operations of the Hudson's
Bay Company. His information on Oregon is, to be sure,
largely the report of hearsay. He includes in his descriptions
the vast region of New Caledonia, whose factors
he met at Fort Vancouver, and whose resources and geography
he describes in general terms. The value of his
Oregon material lies chiefly in the reports of his own experiences
and impressions. It is interesting for us to know
how the Western missionary operations, the progress of
early Willamette settlement, and the aspect of the new land
impressed a vivacious and observant New Englander with
a gift for easy narrative. His book is thus an important
contribution to our series.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The experiences of Father Pierre Jean de Smet, the indefatigable
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>Jesuit missionary traveller, were introduced to our
readers in volume xxvii of this series, where the initiation of
his Flathead mission, in Bitterroot valley, was narrated,
together with his subsequent return to St. Louis by way of
the country of the Crows and the Missouri River. The
second account of his work, which we here republish, is
entitled <i>Oregon Missions and Travels over the Rocky Mountains
in 1845-46</i> (New York, 1847).</p>

<p>After returning from his second journey to the Flathead
country, which included his first visit to the Columbia and
the Oregon settlements (1840-42), Father de Smet went to
Europe to obtain re-inforcements for his mission and apostolic
sanction for his work. Gathering a company of sisters
of Notre Dame to lay the foundation of a convent and school
in the Willamette valley, and enlarging his mission forces
by the addition of a Belgian and three Italian priests, Father
de Smet embarked from Antwerp for a sea voyage to the
North-west Coast. This was sighted July 28, 1844, after a
tedious passage of eight months around Cape Horn.</p>

<p>Having established the nuns in their convent on the Willamette,
Father de Smet set forth across the mountains to
visit his aboriginal neophytes, who had been gathered at
the missions of St. Mary and St. Francis Borgia. On his
way he instituted the mission of St. Ignatius for the Pend
d'Oreilles on the lake of that name. The following year,
a great journey was accomplished by the intrepid missionary
in search of the warlike Blackfeet, whose raids were so
disastrous to the peaceable Indians surrounding the missions.
Thinking best to approach them through the medium
of the Hudson's Bay Company's traders, De Smet proceeded
to the head of Columbia River, crossed the divide to the
waters of the Saskatchewan, and found himself at the company's
Rocky Mountain House on October 5, 1845. After
negotiations with the Blackfeet, he proceeded thence to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
Fort Augustus, where were spent the early weeks of the
winter of 1846. Impatient to be at work, the eager traveller
left his comfortable quarters early in March, proceeding on
the ice to Jasper House, at the eastern end of Athabasca
Pass, pressing on to the "Foot of the Great Glaciere," there
awaiting the Columbian fur-trade brigade which arrived
early in May. The traders reported the pass in a dangerous
condition, for the snow was deep and in a melting
state, and snow-shoes were the only possible means of
travelling. Despite his unwieldy bulk, and his unacquaintance
with such mode of travelling, the resolute missionary
immediately donned the prescribed foot-gear and amid much
hardship and suffering made his way with his faithful Indian
guides over the mountain barrier to the forts of New
Caledonia. Thence he descended the Columbia to Fort
Colville which he reached by the end of May. Allowing
himself but a brief rest, he once more made the round of his
Oregon missions, going to Vancouver and the Willamette,
back across the Spokane plains to the C&#339;ur d'Al&egrave;ne mission,
and finally to St. Mary's, "the nursery of our missionary
operations in the Far West."</p>

<p>The expenses of the enlarging missions required consideration,
so Father de Smet was deputed to visit St. Louis in
their behalf. On the way he once more sought his cherished
object of securing peace with the Blackfeet. This time his
mission proved successful, for after three weeks in a Blackfoot
camp the good priest had the happiness not only to
establish an alliance between the Flathead chiefs who
accompanied him and their redoubtable foes, but also of
reconciling among the Blackfeet themselves two warring
bands of Blood and Piegan Indians. With a thankful
heart the missionary embarked from Fort Lewis, near the
site of the later Fort Benton, leaving Father Point to continue
his labors among the new admirers of the "black gowns."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span></p>

<p>Floating in a tiny skiff down the upper Missouri, Fort
Union was reached October 11; Fort Berthold was passed
seven days later, and the end of the month found our tireless
traveller the guest of Honor&eacute; Picotte at the American
Company's Fort Pierre. Just below Council Bluffs he
encountered Brigham Young and his settlement of ten thousand
Mormons, whose persecutions and sufferings the good
father declares, "will one day probably form a prominent
part of the history of the Far West." Once more in St.
Louis, the missionary terminates his volume with a sketch
of a Potawatomi mission and a graphic account of the custom
of human sacrifice among the Pawnee Loups.</p>

<p>The later career of Father de Smet falls without the field
of our inquiry. Although in "labors abundant" until the
end of his days, he never returned as missionary to the mountain
tribes among whom his earlier days were so happily
but strenuously spent. The superiors of his society found
other work for him in the province of St. Louis, permitting
him only an occasional visit of supervision to his "dear Indians"
of the Far West. Thrice his aid was requested by
the United States government to assist in pacification,
and in important Indian negotiations. His influence
and fame among the red men was so great that a sight
of his black robe was sufficient to impel them to a peaceful
humor. His services to Western settlement were thus
incalculable.</p>

<p>In the volume of <i>Oregon Missions</i>, which we here republish,
De Smet is seen in the fullness of his powers, physical
and mental. With few words, but with graphic touches,
he describes the regions through which he passes, and the
Indian tribes and their customs&mdash;thus adding much to
the material on far Western geography and ethnology
which has already been included in our series.</p>

<h2>PREFACE BY THE FIRST EDITOR</h2>


<p>This authentic account of the Great Western Prairies and
Oregon Territory supplies a deficiency which has been felt
for a long time. The author, by his own personal observations,
has been enabled to furnish a very interesting narrative
of travel; and whether he treats of the Prairies, or of
the Oregon region, the various incidents related by him cannot
fail to give entertainment and instruction.</p>

<p>With respect to the Introduction, in which the Author
asserts the claims of the United States to the Oregon
Territory little need be said here: the subject will no
doubt receive the full consideration of the Governments
interested in the decision of the question.</p>

<h2>PREFACE</h2>


<p>It was customary in old times for all Authors to enter the
world of letters on their knees, and with uncovered head, and
a bow of charming meekness write themselves some brainless
dolt's "most humble and obedient servant." In later
days, the same feigned subserviency has shown itself in other
forms. One desires that some will kindly pardon the weakness
and imbecility of his production; for, although these
faults may exist in his book, he wrote under "most adverse
circumstances," as the crying of a hopeful child, the quarrels
of his poultry, and other disasters of the season.</p>

<p>Another, clothed with the mantle of the sweetest self-complacency,
looks out from his Preface, like a sun-dog
on the morning sky, and merely <i>shines out</i> the query, "Am
I not a Sun?" while he secures a retreat for his self-love,
in case any body should suppose he ever indulged such a
singular sentiment.</p>

<p>{viii} A few others of our literary shades make no pretensions
to modesty. They hold out to the world no need
of aid in laying the foundations of their fame; and, however
adverse the opinions of the times may be to their
claims to renown, they are sure of living hereafter, and
only regret they should have lived a hundred years before
the world was prepared to receive them.</p>

<p>There is another class, who, confident that they understand
the subjects they treat of, if nothing else, and that,
speaking plain truth for the information of plain men, they
cannot fail to narrate matter of interest concerning scenes
or incidents they have witnessed, and sensations they have
experienced&mdash;trouble not themselves with the qualms<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
of inability, or lack of polish, but speak from the heart.
These write their names on their title-pages, and leave
their readers at leisure to judge of their merits as they
develop themselves in the work itself, without any special
pleading or any deprecatory prayers to the reviews, by</p>

<h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>


<p>The Oregon Territory forms the terminus of these
Travels; and, as that country is an object of much interest
on both sides of the Atlantic, I have thought proper to
preface my wanderings there by a brief discussion of the
question as to whom it belongs.</p>

<p>By treaties between the United States and Spain and
Mexico and Russia, the southern boundary of Oregon is
fixed on the 42nd parallel of north latitude; and the northern
on an east and west line, at 54&deg; 40&acute; north.<a name="FNanchor_5" id="FNanchor_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> Its natural
boundary on the east is the main ridge of the Rocky Mountains,
situated about four hundred miles east of the Pacific
Ocean, which washes it on the west. From these data the
reader will observe that it is about six hundred miles in
length, and four hundred in breadth.</p>

<p>According to the well-established laws of nations applicable
to the premises, the title to the sovereignty over it
depends upon the prior discovery and occupancy {x} of it, and
upon cessions by treaty from the first discoverer and occupant.
These several important matters I proceed to examine, with
Greenough's History of the North-west Coast of America, and
the works therein named, before me as sources of reference.<a name="FNanchor_6" id="FNanchor_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span></p>

<p>From the year 1532 to 1540, the Spanish government sent
four expeditions to explore the north-west coast of America,
in search of what did not exist&mdash;a water communication
from the Pacific to the Atlantic. These fleets were severally
commanded by Mazuela, Grijalva, Becera, and Ulloa.
They visited the coast of California, and the south-western
shore of Oregon.<a name="FNanchor_7" id="FNanchor_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p>

<p>The next naval expedition, under the same Power, commanded
by Bartoleme Ferrello, penetrated to the north as
far as latitude 43&deg;, and discovered Cape Blanco.<a name="FNanchor_8" id="FNanchor_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></p>

<p>Juan de Fuca discovered and entered the Straits that
bear his name in the year 1592. He spent twenty days
within the Straits in making himself acquainted with the
surrounding country, trading with the natives, and in taking
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>possession of the adjacent territories in the name of the
Spanish Crown.<a name="FNanchor_9" id="FNanchor_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> The Straits de Fuca enter the land in
latitude 49&deg; north, and, running {xi} one hundred miles in
a south-easterly direction, change their course north-westwardly,
and enter the ocean again under latitude 51&deg; north.
Thus it appears that Spain discovered the Oregon Coast
from latitude 42&deg; to 49&deg; north two hundred and fifty-one
years ago; and, as will appear by reference to dates, one
hundred and eighty-four years prior to the celebrated English
Expedition under Captain Cook.<a name="FNanchor_10" id="FNanchor_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a></p>

<p>In 1602, and subsequent years, Corran and Viscaino, in
the employment of Spain, surveyed many parts of the Oregon
Coast, and in the following year Aguiler, in the same
service, discovered the mouth of the Umpqua River in latitude
44&deg; north.<a name="FNanchor_11" id="FNanchor_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span></p>

<p>In August, 1774, Parez and Martinez, under the Spanish
flag, discovered and anchored in Nootka Sound. It lies
between 49&deg; and 50&deg; of north latitude.<a name="FNanchor_12" id="FNanchor_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a></p>

<p>In 1774 and 1775 the north-west coast was explored by
Parez and Martinez of the Spanish service, as far north as
the 58th parallel of latitude.<a name="FNanchor_13" id="FNanchor_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a></p>

<p>On the 6th day of May, 1789, the Spanish Captain Martinez,
commanding two national armed vessels, took possession
of Nootka Sound and the adjoining country. {xii}
Previous to this event, say the authorities referred to, no
jurisdiction had been exercised by the subjects of any civilized
power on any part of the north-west coast of America
between 37&deg; and 60&deg; of north latitude.</p>

<p>Thus is it shown on how firm and incontrovertible data
the Spanish claims rest to the prior discovery and occupancy
of the Oregon Territory.</p>

<p>But as against England this claim was rendered if possible
more certain by the treaty of February 10th, 1763, between
Spain, England and France&mdash;by which England
was confirmed in her Canadian possessions, and Spain in
her discoveries and purchased possessions west of the Mississippi.
If, then, England has any claim to Oregon as derived
from Spain, it must rest on treaty stipulations entered into
subsequently to the 10th of February, 1763.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span></p>

<p>We accordingly find her to have formed a treaty with
Spain in the year 1800, settling the difficulties between the
two powers in relation to Nootka Sound. By the first
article of the convention, Spain agreed to restore to England
those portions of the country around Nootka Sound which
England {xiii} has so occupied in regard to time and manner
as to have acquired a right to them. The 5th article
stipulates as follows:</p>

<p>"5th. As well in the places which are to be restored to
the British subjects by virtue of the first article as in all other
ports of the North-West Coast of North America, or of the
Island, adjacent, situate to the north of the coast already
occupied by Spain wherein the subjects of either of the
two Powers shall have made settlements since the month
of April 1789, or shall hereafter make any. The subjects
of the other shall have free access and shall carry on their
trade without any disturbance or molestation."<a name="FNanchor_14" id="FNanchor_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a></p>

<p>The inquiries that naturally arise here are, on what places
or parts of the North-West Coast did this article operate;
what rights were granted by it, and to what extent the
United States, as the successors of Spain, in the ownership
of Oregon, are bound by this treaty?</p>

<p>These will be considered in their order.</p>

<p>Clearly the old Spanish settlements of the Californias<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
were not included among the places or parts of the North-West
Coast on which this article was intended to operate,
for the reason that England, the party in {xiv} interest, has
never claimed that they were. But on the contrary, in all her
diplomatic and commercial intercourse with Spain since
1800, she has treated the soil of the Californias with the
same consideration that she has any portion of the Spanish
territories in Europe.&mdash;And since that country has formed
a department of the Mexican Republic, England has set up
no claims within its limits under this treaty.</p>

<p>Was Nootka Sound embraced among the places referred
to in this article? That was the only settlement on the
North-West Coast, of the subjects of Spain or England,
made between the month of April, 1787, and the date of the
treaty, and was undoubtedly embraced in the Fifth Article.
And so was the remainder of the coast, lying northward of
Nootka, on which Spain had claims. It did not extend
south of Nootka Sound. Not an inch of soil in the valley
of the Columbia and its tributaries was included in the provisions
of the treaty of 1763.</p>

<p>Our next inquiry relates to the nature and extent of the
rights at Nootka, and northward, which England acquired
by this treaty. They are defined in the concluding phrase
of the article before cited. The subjects {xv} of both
the contracting Powers "shall have free access, and shall
carry on their trade without disturbance or molestation."
In other words the subjects of England shall have the same
right to establish trading posts and carry on a trade with
the Indians, as were, or should be enjoyed by Spanish
subjects in those regions. Does this stipulation abrogate
the sovereignty of Spain over those territories? England
herself can scarcely urge with seriousness a proposition
so ridiculously absurd. A grant of an equal right to
settle in a country for purposes of trade, and a guarantee<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
against "disturbance" and "molestation," does not, in
any vocabulary, imply a cession of the sovereignty of the
territory in which these acts are to be done.</p>

<p>The number and nature of the rights granted to England
by this treaty, are simply a right to the joint occupancy of
Nootka and the Spanish territories to the northward, for
purposes of trade with the Indians; a joint tenancy, subject
to be terminated at the will of the owner of the title to the
fee and the sovereignty; and, if not thus terminated, to be
terminated by the operations of the necessity of things&mdash;the
annihilation of the trade {xvi}&mdash;the destruction of
the Indians themselves as they should fall before the
march of civilisation. It could not have been a perpetual
right, in the contemplation of either of the contracting
parties.</p>

<p>But there are reasons why the provisions of the treaty of
1763 never had been, and never can be binding on the
United States as the successors of Spain in the Oregon territory.</p>

<p>There is the evidence of private gentlemen of the most
undoubted character to show, that Spain neither surrendered
to England any portion of Nootka, or other parts of the
north-west coast; for that if she offered to do so, the offer
was not acted upon by England; and testimony to the
same effect in the debates of the times in the Parliament
of Britain, in which this important fact is distinctly asserted,
authorise us to declare that the treaty of 1763 was annulled
by Spain, and so considered by England herself. And
if England did not mean to show the world that she
acquiesced in the non-fulfilment of Spain, she should have
re-asserted her rights, if she thought she had any, and not
left third parties to infer that she had quietly abandoned
them. The United States had every reason to infer {xvii}
such abandonment; and in view of it, thus manifested,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
purchased Oregon of Spain. Under these circumstances,
with what justice can England, after the lapse of nearly
half a century, come forward and demand of the successor
of Spain rights in Oregon which she thus virtually abandoned&mdash;which
were refused by Spain, and to which she
never had the shadow of a right on the score of prior
discovery, occupancy or purchase? The perpetually controlling
and selfishness of her policy is the only plea
that history will assign to her in accounting for her
pretensions in this matter.</p>

<p>England also places her claim to Oregon upon the right
of discovery. Let us examine this:&mdash;</p>

<p>The first English vessel which visited that coast was commanded
by Francis Drake. He entered the Pacific in 1770<a name="FNanchor_15" id="FNanchor_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a>
and sailed up the coast to the 45th parallel of north latitude,
and then returned to the 38th degree; accepted the crown
of the native Prince in the name of his Queen&mdash;called the
country New Albion, returned to England and was knighted.</p>

<p>{xviii} The portions of Oregon seen by Drake had
been seen and explored by the Spaniards several times
within the previous thirty years.<a name="FNanchor_16" id="FNanchor_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a></p>

<p>Sir Thomas Cavendish next came upon the coast; but
did not see so much of it as Drake had seen.<a name="FNanchor_17" id="FNanchor_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a></p>

<p>The celebrated Captain Cook followed Cavendish. He
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>saw the coast in latitude 43 and 48 degrees. He passed
the Straits de Fuca without seeing them, and anchored in
Nootka Sound on the 16th February, 1779.<a name="FNanchor_18" id="FNanchor_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> In trading
with the Indians there, he found that they had weapons of
iron, ornaments of brass, and spoons of Spanish manufacture.
Nootka had been discovered and occupied by the
Spaniards four years before Cook arrived.</p>

<p>The subsequent English navigators&mdash;Messrs. Vancouver,<a name="FNanchor_19" id="FNanchor_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a>
and others, so far as the Oregon coast was the field of their
labours, were followers in the tracks pointed out by the
previous discoveries of the Spaniards.</p>

<p>So ends the claim of England to Oregon, on the right of
prior discovery. As opposed to England, Spain's rights on
this principle were incontestible.</p>

<p>{xix} By the treaty of Florida, ratified February 22nd, 1819,
Spain ceded to the United States her right in the Oregon
territory, in the following words: "His Catholic Majesty
cedes to the said United States all his rights, claims, and pretensions
to any territories east and north of said line;"
meaning the 42nd parallel of north latitude, commencing at
the head waters of the Arkansas, and running west to the
Pacific; "and for himself, his heirs and successors, renounces
all claim to the said territories for ever."</p>

<p>But the United States have rights to Oregon which of
themselves annihilate the pretensions not only of England
but the world. Her citizens first discovered that the country
on which Nootka Sound is situated was an island; they
first navigated that part of the Straits of Fuca lying between
Puget's Sound and Queen Charlotte's Island, and discovered
the main coast of north-west America, from latitude 48&deg; to
50&deg; north. American citizens also discovered Queen Charlotte's
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>Island, sailed around it, and discovered the main land
to the east of it, as far north as latitude 55&deg;.<a name="FNanchor_20" id="FNanchor_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a></p>

<p>England can show no discoveries between these latitudes
so important as these; and consequently has not equal rights
with the {xx} Americans as a discoverer, to that part of Oregon
north of the 49th degree of latitude. We also discovered
the Columbia River;<a name="FNanchor_21" id="FNanchor_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> and its whole valley, in virtue of
that discovery, accrues to us under the laws of nations.
One of these laws is that the nation which discovers the
mouth of a river, by implication discovers the whole country
watered by it. We discovered the mouth of the Columbia
and most of its branches; and that valley is ours against the
world&mdash;ours, also, by purchase from Spain, the first discoverer
and occupant of the coast&mdash;ours by prior occupancy
of its great river and valley, and by that law which gives us,
in virtue of such discovery and occupancy, the territories
naturally dependent upon such valley.<a name="FNanchor_22" id="FNanchor_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> We are the rightful
and sole owner of all those parts of Oregon, which are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>not watered by the Columbia, lying on its northern and
southern border, and which, in the language of the law, are
naturally dependent upon it. Oregon territory, for all these
reasons is the rightful property of the United States.</p>

College and later studied medicine in New York, afterwards spending some years
in Europe. In 1828 he was appointed clerk in the department of state at Washington,
where he soon rose to the position of official translator and librarian, an
office retained until 1850, when he went to California with the United States Land
Commission, dying in San Francisco in 1854. In 1837 he prepared, at the request
of the Senate, a <i>History of the Discovery of the North-west Coast</i>, published in <i>Senate
Docs.</i>, 26 Cong., 1 sess., 174. This was later expanded into a <i>History of Oregon
and California</i> (Boston, 1845). His access to the records of the state department,
and his knowledge of Spanish sources, make Greenhow's books authoritative

given in his first volume, regarding these expeditions. His chief source of information
was the work of Herrera, although he secured journals of some of the voyagers
from W. H. Prescott. All of these expeditions were inspired by Hernando
de Cortez. The first (1532) was headed by his kinsman Hurtado de Mendoza,
whose lieutenant Juan de Mazuela brought back one vessel after his superior officer
had been killed. In 1533, Hernando Grivalja and Diego Becerra were sent
to search for the survivors. The former returned without touching mainland;
Becerra was killed in a mutiny, and his pilot, Fortu&ntilde;o Ximenes, is supposed to
have touched the southern end of the peninsula of Lower California. Farnham
omits mention of Cortez's own expedition of 1535-36, when he also is supposed
to have reached Lower California. In 1539-40, Francisco de Ulloa proved that
this was not an island, and explored its coast to about 30&deg; north latitude.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p></div>

1543), but his pilot Bartolom&eacute; Ferrelo sailed farther north. The location of his
northern point of exploration is given as 43&deg;, which would be near Cape Blanco;
but recent editors consider that there was an early error of calculation, and that
Cape Mendocino is the more probable point. Ferrelo in all likelihood advanced
as far as the southern boundary of Oregon. See translation of journal of the expedition,
with valuable notes by H. W. Henshaw, in <i>United States Geographical
Surveys West of the One Hundredth Meridian</i> (Washington, 1879), vii, pp. 293-314.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_9" id="Footnote_9"></a><a href="#FNanchor_9"><span class="label">[9]</span></a> The voyage of Juan de Fuca is generally considered apocryphal. Greenhow,
however, thinks it probable, from the correspondence of the straits now
called by his name with the great passage he claimed to have entered. The only
authority for the alleged voyage of De Fuca, who was a Greek pilot in the service
of Spain, is the relation of Michael Lok, an Englishman, who claimed to have met
De Fuca at Venice. Lok's story was published by Purchas in his <i>Pilgrims</i> (1625)
and on its face was a bid for patronage from the English court.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p></div>

(1602). Corvan returned home from the harbor of Monterey, while Vizcaino
with his lieutenant Martin Aguilar pushed northward. The identification of the
headlands which they named, is now difficult. H. H. Bancroft, <i>History of the
North-west Coast</i> (San Francisco, 1886), i, p. 148, concludes that neither Vizcaino

Martinez penetrated to the northern end of Queen Charlotte's Island, and passed
some months in a bay probably to be identified with Nootka Sound, was not given

themselves, in the person of Captain Cook, the discoverers of this portion of the
North-west Coast.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p></div>

controversy. Martinez seized three English vessels, and carried them as a prize
to San Bias, Mexico. The English resenting this, war nearly ensued, but the
difficulty was adjusted by the Nootka convention, signed October 28, 1790 (not
1800). The Washington State Historical Society has recently signalized this event
by erecting a monument at Nootka Sound, containing the following inscription:
"Vancouver and Quadra [English and Spanish representatives respectively] met
here in August 1792 under the treaty between Spain and Great Britain of October
1790. Erected by the Washington University State Historical Society, August,
1903." The matter was not wholly adjusted until 1795. Consult Bancroft,
<i>North-west Coast</i>, i, pp. 204-238; Greenhow, <i>Oregon and California</i>, pp. 185-215,
and particularly W. R. Manning, "Nootka Sound Controversy," in American

America, searching for a North-west passage. Bancroft concludes (<i>North-west

and Robert Gray. After wintering at Nootka (1788-89), Gray explored the
coast to the northward. Unaware of earlier English explorations, he christened
Queen Charlotte's as Washington Island. The question of Kendrick's exploration
(1790) of Puget Sound is much in doubt. Farnham makes a specious plea
at this point&mdash;his cited authority, Greenhow, admits the discovery (1787) of
Queen Charlotte's Island by Dixon, and by Berkely (1787) of the Straits of Juan
de Fuca. A recent historian of Oregon (H. S. Lyman, <i>History of Oregon</i>, ii, p.

in accordance with the Treaty of Ghent for the restoration of Astoria, which
accordingly was formally transferred, October 6, 1818, to Commissioner J. H.

<p>On the 21st of May, 1839, the author and sixteen others
arrived in the town of Independence, Missouri.<a name="FNanchor_23" id="FNanchor_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> Our destination
was the Oregon Territory. Some of our number
sought health in the wilderness&mdash;others sought the wilderness
for its own sake&mdash;and others sought a residence
among the ancient forests and lofty heights of the valley of
the Columbia; and each actuated by his own peculiar reasons,
or interest, began his preparations for leaving the
frontier.<a name="FNanchor_24" id="FNanchor_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> {2} Pack mules and horses and pack-saddles were
purchased and prepared for service. Bacon and flour, salt
and pepper, sufficient for four hundred miles, were secured
in sacks; our powder-casks were wrapt in painted canvas,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>and large oil-cloths were purchased to protect these and
our sacks of clothing from the rains; our arms were thoroughly
repaired; bullets were moulded; powder-horns and
cap-boxes filled; and all else done that was deemed needful,
before we struck our tent for the Indian territory.</p>

<p>But before leaving this little woodland town, it will be
interesting to remember that it is the usual place of rendezvous
and "outfit" for the overland traders to Santa F&eacute; and
other Mexican states. In the month of May of each year,
these traders congregate here, and buy large Pennsylvania
waggons, and teams of mules to convey their calicoes, cottons,
cloths, boots, shoes, etc. over the plains to that distant
and hazardous market. It is quite amusing to greenhorns,
as those are called who have never been engaged in the trade,
to see the mules make their first attempt at practical pulling.
They are harnessed in a team, two upon the shaft, and the
remainder two abreast in {3} long swinging iron traces; and
then, by way of initiatory intimation that they have passed
from a life of monotonous contemplation, in the seclusion
of their nursery pastures, to the bustling duties of the "Santa
F&eacute; trade," a hot iron is applied to the thigh or shoulder of
each, with an embrace so cordially warm, as to leave there,
in blistered perfection, the initials of their last owner's name.
This done, a Mexican Spaniard, as chief muleteer, mounts
the right-hand wheel mule, and another, the left hand one of
the span next the leaders, while four or five others, as foot-guard,
stand on either side, armed with whips and thongs.
The team is straightened&mdash;and now comes the trial of
passive obedience. The chief muleteer gives the shout of
march, and drives his long spurs into the sides of the animal
that bears him; his companion before follows his
example; but there is no movement. A leer&mdash;an unearthly
bray, is the only response of these martyrs to human
supremacy. Again the team is straightened, again the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
rowel is applied, the body-guard on foot raise the shout, and
all apply the lash at the same moment. The untutored
animals kick and leap, rear and plunge, and fall in their
harness. In fine, they act the mule, {4} and generally
succeed in breaking neck or limb of some one of their
number, and in raising a tumult that would do credit to
any order of animals accustomed to long ears.</p>

<p>After a few trainings, however, of this description, they
move off in fine style. And, although some luckless animal
may at intervals brace himself up to an uncompromising
resistance of such encroachment upon his freedom,
still, the majority preferring passive obedience to active
pelting, drag him onward, till, like themselves, he submits
to the discipline of the traces.</p>

<p>'Independence' was the first location of the <i>Mormons</i>
west of the Mississippi. Here they laid out grounds for
their temple, built the 'Lord's store,' and in other ways
prepared the place for the permanent establishment of their
community. But, becoming obnoxious to their neighbours,
they crossed the Missouri, and founded the town of 'Far
West.' In 1838 they recommenced certain practices of
their faith in their new abode, and were ejected from the
state by its military forces.<a name="FNanchor_25" id="FNanchor_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a></p>

<p>The misfortunes of these people seem to have arisen
from proceeding upon certain rules of action peculiar to
themselves. The basis of these rules is the assumption that
{5} they are the "Saints of the Most High," to whom the
Lord promised of old the inheritance of the earth; and that
as such they have the right to take possession of whatever
they may be inspired to desire. Any means are justifiable,
in their belief, to bring about the restoration to the
"Children of God" of that which He has bequeathed to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
them. In obedience to these rules of action, any Mormon or
"Latter-Day Saint" labouring for hire on a "worldly"
man's plantation, claimed the right to direct what improvements
should be made on the premises; what trees should
be felled, and what grounds should, from time to time, be
cultivated. If this prerogative of saintship were questioned
by the warm-blooded Missourians, they were with great coolness
and gravity informed that their godly servants expected
in a short time to be in comfortable possession of their
employers' premises; for that the Latter-Days had come,
and with them the Saints; that wars and carnage were to
be expected; and that the Latter-Day Prophet had learned,
in his communications with the Court of Heaven, that the
Missourians were to be exterminated on the first enlargement
of the borders of "Zion;" and that over the graves of those
"enemies {6} of all righteousness" would spring that vast
spiritual temple which was "to fill the earth."</p>

<p>The prospect of being thus immolated upon the altar of
Mormonism, did not produce so much humility and trembling
among these hardy frontiersmen as the prophet Joe
had benevolently desired. On the contrary, the pious
intimation that their throats would be cut to glorify God,
was resisted by some ruthless and sinful act of self-defence;
and all the denunciations of the holy brotherhood were
impiously scorned as idle words. However, in spite of the
irreligious wrath of these deluded, benighted Missourians,
the Saints cut timber wherever they listed on the domains
which were claimed by the people of the world. And if
the "Lord's hogs or horses" wanted corn, the farms in the
hands of the wicked were resorted to at a convenient hour
of the night for a supply. In all these cases, the "Saints"
manifested a kind regard to the happiness even of the
enemies of their faith. For whenever they took corn from
fields in possession of the world's people, they not only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
avoided exciting unholy wrath by allowing themselves to
be seen in the act, but, in order that peace might {7} reign
in the bosoms of the wicked, even, the longest possible
time, they stripped that portion of the harvest field which
would be last seen by the ungodly owner.</p>

<p>The "Church militant," however, being inefficient and
weak, the Prophet Joe declared that it was their duty to
use whatever means the Lord might furnish to strengthen
themselves. And as one powerful means would be the keeping
of its doings as much as possible from the world, it was
he said, the will of Heaven, revealed to him in proper form,
that in no case, when called before the ungodly tribunals of
this perverse and blind generation, should they reveal, for
any cause, any matter or thing which might, in its consequences,
bring upon the brotherhood the infliction of those
pretended rules of Justice, by the world called Laws. Under
the protection of this prophecy, a band of the brethren was
organized, called the "Tribe of Dan," whose duty it was to
take and bring to the "Lord's store," in the far West, any
of the Lord's personal estate which they might find in the
possession of the world, and which might be useful to the
"Saints," in advancing their kingdom. Great good is said
to have been done by this Tribe of Dan; {8} for the Lord's
store was soon filled, and the Saints praised the name of
Joe. The Prophet's face shone with the light of an all-subduing
delight at the increase of "Zion," and the
efficiency of his administration.</p>

<p>The Missourians, however, were destitute of the Latter-Day
Faith, and of just views of the rights devised to those,
who, in the Lord's name, should destroy his adversaries,
and restore the earth to the dominion of millennial righteousness.
Poor mortals and deluded sinners! They believed
that the vain and worldly enactments of legislative bodies
were to prevail against the inspirations of the Latter-Day<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
Prophet Joe; and in their unsanctified zeal, declared the
Saints to be thieves, and unjust, and murderous; and the
Tribe of Dan to be a pest to the constitutional and acknowledged
inherent and natural right to acquire, possess, and
enjoy property. From this honest difference of opinion
arose the "Mormon War," whose great events are recorded
in the narrative of the "Latter-Day Saints?" Some events,
there were, however, not worthy to find record there, which
may be related here.</p>

<p>The Governor of the Missouri<a name="FNanchor_26" id="FNanchor_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> ordered {9} out the State
troops to fight and subdue the Mormons, and take from
them the property which the "Tribe of Dan" had deposited
in the "Lord's brick store" in the "citadel of Zion," called
"Far West." It was in 1838 they appeared before the
camp of the "Saints" and commanded them to surrender.
It was done in the manner hereafter described. But before
this event transpired, I am informed that the Prophet Joe
opened his mouth in the name of the Lord, and said it had
been revealed to him that the scenes of Jericho were to be
re-enacted in Far West; that the angelic host would appear
on the day of battle, and by their power give victory to the
"Saints."</p>

<p>To this end he ordered a breastwork of inch pine boards
to be raised around the camp, to show by this feeble protection
against the artillery of their foes, that their strength
was in the "breast-plate of righteousness," and that they
were the soldiers of the militant portion of the Kingdom of
Heaven. There were moments of awful suspense in the
camp of the "Saints." The Missouri bayonets bristled
brightly near their ranks, and an occasional bullet carelessly
penetrated the pine-board rampart, regardless of
the inhibition of the {10} Prophet. The Heavens were gazed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
upon for the shining host, and listening ears turned to catch
the rushing of wings through the upper air. The demand
of surrender was again and again repeated; but Faith
had seized on Hope, and Delay was the offspring.</p>

<p>At this juncture of affairs, a sturdy old Missourian approached
the brick store, pickaxe in hand, apparently determined
to do violence to the sacred depository. One of the
sisters in robes of white accosted him, and with proper solemnity
made known that the "Lord of the Faithful" had revealed
to Joe, the Prophet, that every hand raised against
that "holy structure" would instantly be withered. The
frontiersman hesitated, but the hardihood characteristic of
these men of the rifle returning, he replied, "Well, old gal,
I'll go it on one hand any how." The awful blow was
struck; the hand did not wither! "I doubles up now,"
said the daring man, and with both hands inflicted a heavy
blow upon a corner brick. It tumbled to the ground, and
the building quickly fell under the weight of a thousand
vigorous arms. The confidence of the Saints in their
Prophet waned, and a surrender followed, {11} Some of
the principal men were put in custody, but the main body
were permitted to leave the State without farther molestation.
We afterwards met many of them with their herds,
&amp;c., on the road from Far West to Quincy, Illinois. It was
strongly intimated by the planters in that section of country,
that these emigrating "saints" found large quantities of
the "Lord's corn" on their way, which they appropriated
as need suggested to their own and their animals' wants.</p>

<p>The origin of the "Book of Mormon"<a name="FNanchor_27" id="FNanchor_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> was for some
time a mystery. But recent developments prove it to have
been written in 1812 by the Rev. Solomon Spaulding, of
New Salem, in the state, Ohio. It was composed by that
gentleman as a historical romance of the long extinct race
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>who built the mounds and forts which are scattered over
the valley States. Mr. Spaulding read the work while composing
it to some of his friends, who, on the appearance of
the book in print, were so thoroughly convinced of its identity
with the romance of their deceased pastor, that search
was made, and the original manuscript found among his
papers. But there was yet a marvel how the work could
have got into the hands of Joe {12} Smith. On further
investigation, however, it appeared that the reverend author
had entertained thoughts of publishing it; and, in
pursuance of his intention, had permitted it to lie a long
time in the printing office in which Sidney Rigdon, who has
figured so prominently in the history of the Mormons, was
at the time employed.<a name="FNanchor_28" id="FNanchor_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> Rigdon, doubtless, copied poor
Spaulding's novel, and with it, and the aid of Joe Smith,
has succeeded in building up a system of superstition, which,
in vileness and falsehood, is scarcely equalled by that of
Mahomet.</p>

<p>Solomon Spaulding was a graduate of Dartmouth College.</p>

<p>On the 30th of May, we found ourselves prepared to
move for the Indian Territory.<a name="FNanchor_29" id="FNanchor_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> Our pack-saddles being
girded upon the animals, our sacks of provisions, &amp;c. snugly
lashed upon them, and protected from the rain that had begun
to fall, and ourselves well mounted and armed, we took
the road that leads off south-west from Independence in the
direction of Santa F&eacute;.<a name="FNanchor_30" id="FNanchor_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> But the rains which had accompanied
us daily since we left Peoria, seemed determined to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>escort us still, our ill-natured scowls to the contrary notwithstanding:
for we had travelled only three miles when
{13} such torrents fell, that we found it necessary to take
shelter in a neighbouring schoolhouse for the night. It was
dismal enough; but a blazing fire within, and a merry song
from a jovial member of our company imparted as much
consolation as our circumstances seemed to demand, till we
responded to the howling storm the sonorous evidence of
sweet and quiet slumber.</p>

<p>The following morning was clear and pleasant, and we
were early on our route. We crossed the stream called Big
Blue, a tributary of the Missouri,<a name="FNanchor_31" id="FNanchor_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> about twelve o'clock,
and approached the border of the Indian domains. All
were anxious now to see and linger over every object which
reminded us we were still on the confines of that civilization
which we had inherited from a thousand generations; a
vast and imperishable legacy of civil and social happiness.
It was, therefore, painful to approach the last frontier
enclosure&mdash;the last habitation of the white man&mdash;the last
semblance of home. At length the last cabin was approached.
We drank at the well and travelled on. It was now behind
us. All, indeed was behind us with which the sympathies
of our young days had mingled their holy memories. Before
us were the treeless {14} plains of green, as they had been
since the flood&mdash;beautiful, unbroken by bush or rock; unsoiled
by plough or spade; sweetly scented with the first
blossomings of the spring. They had been, since time commenced,
the theatre of the Indian's prowess&mdash;of his hopes,
joys, and sorrows. Here, nations, as the eve of deadly battle
closed around them, had knelt and raised the votive offering
to Heaven, and implored the favour and protection of the
Great Spirit who had fostered their fathers upon the wintry
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>mountains of the North, and when bravely dying, had borne
them to the islands of light beneath the setting sun. A
lovely landscape this, for an Indian's meditation! He
could almost behold in the distance where the plain and
sky met, the holy portals of his after-state so mazy and
beautiful was the scene!</p>

<p>Having travelled about twenty-five miles over this beautiful
prairie, we halted on the banks of a small stream at a
place called Elm Grove.<a name="FNanchor_32" id="FNanchor_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> Here we pitched our tent, tied
our horses to stakes, carried for that purpose, and after considerable
difficulty having obtained fuel for a fire, cooked
and ate for the first time in the Indian Territory.</p>

<p>At this encampment final arrangements {15} were made
for our journey over the Prairies. To this end provisions,
arms, ammunition, packs and pack-saddles, were overhauled,
and an account taken of our common stock of goods
for trade with the Indians. The result of this examination
was, that we determined to remain here a while, and send
back to the Kauzaus Indian mill for two hundred pounds of
flour. We were induced to take this step by assurances
received from certain traders whom we met coming from the
mountains, that the buffalo had not advanced so far north
as to furnish us with their fine hump-ribs so early by a
week or fortnight as we had expected. Officers were also
chosen and their powers defined; and whatever leisure
we found from these duties during a stay of two days, was
spent in regaling ourselves with strawberries and gooseberries,
which grew in great abundance near our camp.</p>

<p>Our friends having returned from the mill with the flour
for which they had been despatched, we left Elm Grove on
the 3rd of June, travelled along the Santa F&eacute; trail about
fifteen miles, and encamped upon a high knoll, from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
which we had an extensive view of the surrounding plains.
The grass was now about four inches in height, and
{16} bent and rose in most sprightly beauty under the gusts
of wind which at intervals swept over it. We remained
here a day and a half, waiting for two of our number
who had gone in search of a horse that had left our
encampment at Elm Grove. The time, however, passed
agreeably. We were, indeed, beyond the sanctuaries of
society, and severed from the kind pulsations of friendship;
but the spirit of the Red Man, wild and careless as the
storms he buffets, began to come over us; and we
shouldered our rifles and galloped away for a deer in the
lines of timber that threaded the western horizon. Our
first hunt in the depths of the beautiful and dreadful
wilderness! It was attended with no success, however,
but was worth the effort. We had begun to hunt our
food.</p>

<p>In the afternoon of the 4th, our friends returned with the
strayed animals. The keepers immediately fired the signalguns,
and all were soon in camp. Our road on the 5th was
through a rich, level prairie, clothed with the wild grass common
to the plains of the West. A skirt of black oak timber
occasionally lined the horizon or strayed up a deep
ravine near the trail. The extreme care of the pioneers in
the {17} overland Santa F&eacute; trade was every where noticeable,
in the fact that the track of their richly-loaded waggons never
approached within musket-shot of these points of timber.
Fifteen miles' march brought us to our place of encampment.
A certain portion of the company allotted to that
labour, unpacked the company's mules of the common-stock
property, provisions, ammunitions, &amp;c.; another portion
pitched the tent; another gathered wood and kindled
a fire; whilst others brought water, and still others again
put seething-pots and frying-pans to their appropriate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
duties. So that at this, as at many a time before and after,
a few minutes transposed our little cavalcade from a moving
troop into an eating, drinking, and joyous camp. A
thunder-storm visited us during the night. The lightning
was intensely vivid, and the explosions were singularly frequent
and loud. The sides of the heavens appeared to
war like contending batteries in deadly conflict. The rain
came in floods; and our tent, not being ditched around,
was flooded soon after the commencement of the storm, and
ourselves and baggage thoroughly drenched.</p>

<p>The next day we made about fifteen miles through the
mud and rain, and stopped for {18} the night near a solitary
tree upon the bank of a small tributary of the Konzas river.
Here fortune favoured our fast decreasing larder. One
of the company killed a turtle, which furnished us all with
an excellent supper. This was the only description of game
that we had seen since leaving the frontier.</p>

<p>On the 7th, as the sun was setting, we reached Osage
River&mdash;a stream which flows into the Missouri below Jefferson
City. The point where we struck it, was one hundred
miles south-west of Independence.<a name="FNanchor_33" id="FNanchor_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> We pitched our
tent snugly by a copse of wood within a few yards of it;
staked down our animals near at hand, and prepared, and
ate in the usual form, our evening repast. Our company
was divided into two messes, seven in one, and eight in the
other. On the ground, each with a tin pint cup and a
small round plate of the same material, the first filled with
coffee, tea, or water, the last with fried bacon and dough
fried in fat; each with a butcher-knife in hand, and each
mess sitting, tailor-like, around its own frying-pan, eating
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>with the appetite of tigers formed the <i>coup-d'&#339;il</i> of our
company at supper on the banks of the Osage.</p>

<p>{19} Near us were encamped some waggoners on their
return to Missouri, who had been out to Council Grove with
the provisions and that part of the goods of the Santa F&eacute;
traders which the teams of untrained mules had been unable
to draw when they left Independence. With these men
we passed a very agreeable evening; they amused us with
yarns of mountain-life, which from time to time had floated
in, and formed the fireside legends of that wild border. In
the morning, while we were saddling our animals, two of
the Kauzaus Indians came within a few rods of our camp,<a name="FNanchor_34" id="FNanchor_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a>
and waited for an invitation to approach. They were armed
with muskets and knives. The manner of carrying their
fire-arms was peculiar, and strongly characteristic of Indian
caution. The breech was held in the right hand, and
the barrel rested on the left arm; thus they are always prepared
to fire. They watched us narrowly, as if to ascertain
whether we were friends or foes, and upon our making
signs to them to approach, they took seats near the fire, and
with most imperturbable calmness, commenced smoking
the compound of willow-bark and tobacco with which they
are wont to regale themselves. When we left the ground,
one of {20} the men threw away a pair of old boots, the soles
of which were fastened with iron nails. Our savage visitors
seized upon them with the greatest eagerness, and in their
pantomimic language, aided by harsh, guttural grunts, congratulated
themselves upon becoming the possessors of so
much wealth. At eight o'clock we were on march.</p>

<p>The morning breezes were bland, and a thousand young
flowers gemmed the grassy plains. It seemed as if the
tints of a brighter sky and the increasing beauty of the earth
were lifting the clouds from the future, and shedding vigour<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
upon our hopes. But this illusion lasted but a moment.
Three of my valuable men had determined to accompany
the waggoners to the States; and as they filed off and
bade adieu to the enterprise in which they had embarked,
and blighted many cheering expectations of social intercourse
along our weary wayfaring to Oregon, an expression
of deep discouragement shaded every face. This was
of short duration. The determination to penetrate the
valleys of Oregon soon swept away every feeling of depression,
and two hunters being sent forward to replenish our
larder, we travelled happily onward.</p>

<p>The Osage River at this place is one {21} hundred yards
wide, with about two-and-a-half feet of water. Its banks
are clothed with timber of cotton-wood, ash and hickory.
We crossed it at eight o'clock in the morning, passed
through the groves which border it, and continued to follow
the Santa F&eacute; trail. The portion of country over which it
ran was undulating and truly beautiful; the soil rich,
very deep, and intersected by three small streams, which
appeared from their courses to be tributaries of the Osage.</p>

<p>At nightfall, we found ourselves upon a height overlooking
a beautiful grove. This we supposed to be Council
Grove. On the swell of the hill were the remains of an old
Kauzaus' encampment; a beautiful clear spring gushed out
from the rock below. The whole was so inviting to us, weary
and hungry as we were, that we determined to make our
bed there for the night. Accordingly, we fired signalguns
for the hunters, pitched our tents, broke up the boughs
which had been used by the Indians in building their wigwams,
for fuel, and proceeded to cook our supper. This
encampment had been made by the Kauzaus six years ago,
when on their way south to their annual buffalo-hunt.
A semi-circular piece of ground was enclosed by the outer
lodges. {22} The area was filled with wigwams, built in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
straight lines, running from the diameter to the circumference.
They were constructed in the following manner.
Boughs of about two inches in diameter were inserted by
their butts into the ground, and withed together at the top
in an arched form; over these were spread blankets, skins
of the buffalo, etc. Fires were built in front of each: the
grass beneath, covered with skins, made a delightful couch,
and the Indian's home was complete. Several yards from
the outer semi-circular row of lodges and parallel to it, we
found large stakes driven firmly into the earth, for the purpose
of securing their horses during the night. We appropriated
to ourselves, without hesitation, whatever we found here of
earth, wood or water, which could be useful to us, and were
soon very comfortable. About nine o'clock, our signalguns
were answered by the return of our hunters. They
had scoured the country all day in quest of game, but found
none. Our hopes were somewhat depressed by this result.
We had but one hundred pounds of flour and one side of
bacon left; and the buffalo, by the best estimates we could
make, were still three hundred miles distant; the country
between {23} us and these animals, too, being constantly
scoured by Indian hunters, afforded us but little prospect
of obtaining other game. However, we did not dwell very
minutely upon the evils that might await us, but having put
ourselves upon short allowance, and looked at our horses as
the means of preventing starvation, we sought rest for
the fatigues of the next day's march.</p>

<p>In the morning we moved down the hill. Our way lay
directly through the little grove already referred to; and,
however we might have admired its freshness and beauty,
we were deterred from entering into the full enjoyment
of the scene by the necessity, which we supposed existed, of
keeping a sharp look-out among its green recesses for the
lurking savage. The grove is the northern limit of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
wanderings of the Cumanches&mdash;a tribe of Indians who
make their home on the rich plains along the western
borders of the republic of Texas.<a name="FNanchor_35" id="FNanchor_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> Their ten thousand
warriors, their incomparable horsemanship, their terrible
charge, the unequalled rapidity with which they load
and discharge their fire-arms, and their insatiable hatred,
make the enmity of these Indians more dreadful than
that of any other tribe of aborigines. Fortunately for us,
however, {24} these Spartans of the plains did not appear,
and right merrily did we cross the little savannah between
it and Council Grove, a beautiful lawn of the wilderness,
some of the men hoping for the sweets of the bee-tree,
others for a shot at a turkey or a deer, and others again
that among the drooping boughs and silent glades might
be found the panting loins of a stately elk.</p>

<p>Council Grove derives its name from the practice among
the traders, from the commencement of the overland commerce
with the Mexican dominions, of assembling there for
the appointment of officers and the establishment of rules
and regulations to govern their march through the dangerous
country south of it. They first elect their commander-in-chief.<a name="FNanchor_36" id="FNanchor_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a>
His duty is to appoint subordinate leaders, and to
divide the owners and men into watches, and to assign
them their several hours of duty in guarding the camp
during the remainder of their perilous journey. He also
divides the caravan into two parts, each of which forms a
column when on march. In these lines he assigns each
team the place in which it must always be found. Having
arranged these several matters, the council breaks up; and
the commander, with the guard on {25} duty, moves off in
advance to select the tract and anticipate approaching danger.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span></p>

<p>After this guard the head teams of each column lead
off about thirty feet apart, and the others follow in regular
lines, rising and dipping gloriously; two hundred men, one
hundred waggons, eight hundred mules; shoutings and
whippings, and whistlings and cheerings, are all there; and,
amidst them all, the hardy Yankee move happily onward to
the siege of the mines of Montezuma. Several objects are
gained by this arrangement of the waggons. If they are
attacked on march by the Cumanche cavalry or other foes,
the leading teams file to the right and left, and close the
front; and the hindermost, by a similar movement, close
the rear; and thus they form an oblong rampart of waggons
laden with cotton goods that effectually shields teams
and men from the small arms of the Indians. The same
arrangement is made when they halt for the night.</p>

<p>Within the area thus formed are put, after they are fed,
many of the more valuable horses and oxen. The remainder
of the animals are 'staked'&mdash;that is, tied to stakes, at
a distance of twenty or thirty yards, around the line. The
ropes by which {26} they are fastened are from thirty to
forty feet in length, and the stakes to which they are attached
are carefully driven, at such distances apart, as shall prevent
their being entangled one with another.</p>

<p>Among these animals the guard on duty is stationed,
standing motionless near them, or crouching so as to discover
every moving spot upon the horizon of night. The
reasons assigned for this, are, that a guard in motion would
be discovered and fired upon by the cautious savage before
his presence could be known; and farther, that it is impossible
to discern the approach of an Indian creeping among
the grass in the dark, unless the eye of the observer be so
close to the ground as to bring the whole surface lying within
the range of vision between it and the line of light around
the lower edge of the horizon. If the camp be attacked,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
the guard fire and retreat to the waggons. The whole body
then take positions for defence; at one time sallying out,
rescue their animals from the grasp of the Indians; and at
another, concealed behind their waggons, load and fire upon
the intruders with all possible skill and rapidity. Many
were the bloody battles fought on the 'trail,' and such were
some of the anxieties {27} and dangers that attended and
still attend the 'Santa F&eacute; Trade.' Many are the graves,
along the track, of those who have fallen before the terrible
cavalry of the Cumanches. They slumber alone in this
ocean of plains; no tears bedew their graves; no lament
of affection breaks the stillness of their tomb. The tramp
of savage horsemen&mdash;the deep bellowing of the buffalo&mdash;the
nightly howl of the hungry wolf&mdash;the storms that sweep
down at midnight from the groaning caverns of the 'shining
heights;' or, when Nature is in a tender mood, the sweet
breeze that seems to whisper among the wild flowers that
nod over his dust in the spring&mdash;say to the dead, "You are
alone; no kindred bones moulder at your side."</p>

<p>We traversed Council Grove with the same caution and
in the same manner as we had the other; a platoon of four
persons in advance to mark the first appearance of an ambuscade;
behind these the pack animals and their drivers; on
each side an unincumbered horseman; in the rear a platoon
of four men, all on the look-out, silent, with rifles lying on
the saddles in front, steadily winding along the path that
the heavy waggons of the traders had made among the {28}
matted underbrush. In this manner we marched half a
mile, and emerged from the Grove at a place where the
traders had, a few days before, held their council. The
grass in the vicinity had been gnawed to the earth by their
numerous animals; their fires were still smouldering and
smoking; and the ruts in the road were fresh. These
indications of our vicinity to the great body of the traders<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
produced an exhilarating effect on our spirits; and we
drove merrily away along the trail, cheered with renewed
hopes that we should overtake our countrymen, and be
saved from starvation.</p>

<p>The grove that we were now leaving was the largest and
most beautiful we had passed since leaving the frontier of
the States. The trees, maple, ash, hickory, black walnut,
oaks of several kinds, butternut, and a great variety of
shrubs clothed with the sweet foliage of June&mdash;a pure
stream of water murmuring along a gravelly bottom, and
the songs of the robin and thrush, made Council Grove a
source of delight to us, akin to those that warm the hearts
of pilgrims in the great deserts of the East, when they behold,
from the hills of scorching sands, the green thorn-tree,
and {29} the waters of the bubbling spring. For we also
were pilgrims in a land destitute of the means of subsistence,
with a morsel only of meat and bread per day, lonely and
hungry; and although we were among the grassy plains
instead of a sandy waste, we had freezing storms, tempests,
lightning and hail, which, if not similar in the means, were
certainly equal in the amount of discomfort they produced,
to the sand-storms of the Great Sahara.</p>

<p>But we were leaving the Grove and the protection it might
yield to us in such disagreeable circumstances. On the
shrubless plain again! To our right the prairie rose gradually,
and stretched away for ten miles, forming a beautiful
horizon. The whole was covered with a fine coat of grass
a foot in height, which was at this season of the deepest and
richest green. Behind us lay a dark line of timber, reaching
from the Grove far into the eastern limits of sight, till the
leafy tops seemed to wave and mingle among the grass of the
wild swelling meadows. The eyes ached as we endeavoured
to embrace the view. A sense of vastness was the
single and sole conception of the mind!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span></p>

<p>Near this grove are some interesting Indian {30} ruins.
They consist of a collection of dilapidated mounds, seeming
to indicate the truth of the legend of the tribes, which says,
that formerly this was the Holy ground of the nations,
where they were accustomed to meet to adjust their difficulties,
exchange the salutations of peace, and cement the bonds
of union with smoking, and dancing, and prayers, to the
Great Spirit.</p>

<p>We had advanced a few miles in the open country when
we discovered, on the summit to the right, a small band of
Indians. They proved to be a party of Caws or Kauzaus.
As soon as they discovered our approach, two of them
started in different directions at the top of their speed, to
spread the news of our arrival among the remote members
of the party. The remainder urged on with the utmost
velocity their pack-horses laden with meat, skins, blankets,
and other paraphernalia of a hunting excursion. We pursued
our way, making no demonstrations of any kind, until
one old brave left his party, and came towards us, stationing
himself beside our path, and awaiting our near approach.
He stood quite upright and motionless. As we advanced,
we noted closely his appearance {31} and position. He had
no clothing, except a blanket tied over the left shoulder and
drawn under the right arm. His head was shaven entirely
bare, with the exception of a tuft of hair about two inches
in width, extending from the center of the occiput over the
middle of the head to the forehead. It was short and
coarse, and stood erect, like a comb of a cock. His figure
was the perfection of physical beauty. It was five feet nine
or ten inches in height, and looked the Indian in every
respect. He stood by the road-side, apparently perfectly at
ease; and seemed to regard all surrounding objects, with as
much interest as he did us. This is a distinguishing characteristic
of the Indian. If a thunderbolt could be embodied<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
and put in living form before their eyes, it would not startle
them from their gravity. So stood our savage friend, to
all appearance unaware of our approach. Not a muscle of
his body or face moved, until I rode up and proffered him
a friendly hand. This he seized eagerly and continued to
shake it very warmly, uttering meanwhile with great emphasis
and rapidity, the words "How de," "how," "how."
As soon as one individual had withdrawn his hand from
his grasp, he {32} passed to another, repeating the same process
and the same words. From the careful watch we had
kept upon his movements since he took his station, we had
noticed that a very delicate operation had been performed
upon the lock of his gun. Something had been warily removed
therefrom, and slipped into the leathern pouch worn
at his side. We expected, therefore, that the never-failing
appeal to our charity would be made for something; and in
this we were not disappointed. As soon as the greetings
were over, he showed us, with the most solicitous gestures,
that his piece had no flint. We furnished him with one;
and he then signified to us that he would like something to
put in the pan and barrel; and having given him something
of all, he departed at the rapid swinging gait so peculiar to
his race.</p>

<p>As we advanced, the prairie became more gently undulating.
The heaving ridges which had made our trail thus
far appear to pass over an immense sea, the billows of which
had been changed to waving meadows the instant they had
escaped from the embraces of the tempest, gave place to
wide and gentle swells, scarcely perceptible over the increased
expanse in sight. Ten {33} miles on the day's
march; the animals were tugging lustily through the mud,
when the advance guard shouted "Elk! Elk!" and "steaks
broiled," and "ribs boiled," and "marrow bones," and
"no more hunger!" "Oregon for ever, starve or live," as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
an appointed number of my companions filed off to the
chase.</p>

<p>The hunters circled around the point of the sharp ridge
on which the Elk were feeding, in order to bring them between
themselves and the wind; and laying closely to their
horses' necks, they rode slowly and silently up the ravine
towards them. While these movements were making, the
cavalcade moved quietly along the trail for the purpose of
diverting the attention of the Elk from the hunters. And
thus the latter were enabled to approach within three hundred
yards of the game before they were discovered. But
the instant&mdash;that anxious instant to our gnawing appetites&mdash;the
instant that they perceived the crouching forms of
their pursuers approaching them, tossing their heads in the
air, and snuffing disdainfully at such attempt to deceive
their wakeful senses, they put hoof to turf in fine style. The
hunters attempted pursuit; but having to ascend one side of
the ridge, {34} while the Elk in their flight descended the
other, they were at least four hundred yards distant, before
the first bullet whistled after them. None were killed.
And we were obliged to console our hunger with the hope
that three hunters, who had been despatched ahead this
morning, would meet with more success. We encamped
soon after this tourney of ill luck&mdash;ate one of the last
morsels of food that remained&mdash;pitched our tent, stationed
the night-guard, &amp;c., and, fatigued and famished, stretched
ourselves within it.</p>

<p>On the following day we made twenty-five miles over a
prairie nearly level, and occasionally marshy. In the afternoon
we were favoured with what we had scarcely failed,
for a single day, to receive since the commencement of our
journey, viz: all several and singular, the numerous benefits
of a thunder-storm. As we went into camp at night,
the fresh ruts along the trail indicated the near vicinity of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
some of the Santa F&eacute; teams. No sleep; spent the night in
drying our drenched bodies and clothes.</p>

<p>On the 12th under weigh very early: and travelled briskly
along, intending to overtake the traders before nightfall.
But {35} another thunder-storm for a while arrested the
prosecution of our desires.&mdash;It was about three o'clock
when a black cloud arose in the south-east, another in the
south-west, and another in the north-east; and involving
and evolving themselves like those that accompany tornadoes
of other countries, they rose with awful rapidity
towards the zenith. Having mingled their dreadful masses
over our heads, for a moment they struggled so terrifically
that the winds appeared hushed at the voice of their dread
artillery&mdash;a moment of direful battle; and yet not a breath
of wind. We looked up for the coming catastrophe indicated
by the awful stillness; and beheld the cloud rent in
fragments, by the most terrific explosion of electricity we
had ever witnessed. Then, as if every energy of the destroying
elements had been roused by this mighty effort, peal
upon peal of thunder rolled around, and up and down the
heavens; and the burning bolts appeared to leap from cloud
to cloud across the sky, and from heaven to earth, in such
fearful rapidity, that the lurid glare of one had scarcely
fallen on the sight, when another followed of still greater
intensity. The senses were absolutely {36} stunned by the
conflict. Our animals, partaking of the stupefying horror
of the scene, madly huddled themselves together and became
immovable. They heeded neither whip nor spur;
but with backs to the tempest drooped their heads, as if
awaiting their doom. The hail and rain came down in
torrents. The plains were converted into a sea; the sky,
overflowing with floods, lighted by a continual blaze of
electric fire! It was such a scene as no pen can adequately
describe.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span></p>

<p>After the violence of the storm had in some degree abated,
we pursued our way, weary, cold and hungry. About six
o'clock we overtook a company of Santa F&eacute; traders, commanded
by Captain Kelly. The gloom of the atmosphere
was such, that when we approached his camp, Captain
Kelly supposed us to be Indians, and took measures accordingly
to defend himself. Having stationed his twenty-nine
men within the barricade formed by his waggons, he himself,
accompanied by a single man, came out to reconnoitre.
He was not less agreeably affected, to find us whites and
friends, than were we at the prospect of society and food.
Traders always carry a supply of wood over these naked
plains, {37} and it may be supposed that, drenched and
pelted as we had been by the storm, we did not hesitate to
accept the offer of their fire to cook our supper, and warm
ourselves. But the rain continued to fall in cold shivering
floods; and, fire excepted, we might as well have been elsewhere
as in company with our countrymen, who were as badly
sheltered and fed, as ourselves. We, therefore, cast about
for our own means of comfort. While some were cooking
our morsel of supper, others staked out the animals, others
pitched our tent; and all, when their tasks were done,
huddled under its shelter. We now numbered thirteen.</p>

<p>We ate our scanty suppers, drank the water from the
puddles, and sought rest. But all our packs being wet, we
had no change of wardrobe, that would have enabled us to
have done so with a hope of success. We, however, spread
our wet blankets upon the mud, put our saddles under
our heads, had a song from our jolly Joe, and mused and
shivered until morning.</p>

<p>As the sun of the 13th rose, we drove our animals through
Cottonwood creek.<a name="FNanchor_37" id="FNanchor_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> It had been very much swollen by the
rains of the previous day; and our packs {38} and ourselves,
were again thoroughly wet. But, once out of the
mire and the dangers of the flood, our hearts beat merrily
as we lessened, step by step, the distance from Oregon.</p>

<p>Our hunters, who had been despatched from Council
Grove in search of game, had rejoined us in Kelly's camp.
And as our larder had not been improved by the hunt,
another party was sent out, under orders to advance to the
buffalo with all possible dispatch, and send back to the
main body a portion of the first meat that should be taken.
This was a day of mud and discomfort. Our pack and
riding animals, constantly annoyed by the slippery clay
{40} beneath them, became restive, and not unfrequently
relieved themselves of riders or packs, with little apparent
respect for the wishes of their masters. And yet, as if a
thousand thorns should hatchel out at least one rose, we
had one incident of lively interest. For, while halting to
secure the load of a pack-mule, whose obstinacy would have
entitled him to that name, whatever had been his form, we
espied upon the side of a neighbouring ravine several elk
and antelope. The men uttered pleas for their stomachs at
the sight of so much fine meat, and with teeth shut in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
agony of expectation, primed anew their rifles, and rushed
away for the prize.</p>

<p>Hope is very delusive, when it hunts elk upon the open
plain. This fact was never more painfully true, than in the
present instance. They were approached against the wind&mdash;the
ravines that were deepest, and ran nearest the elk,
were traversed in such a manner that the huntsmen were
within three hundred yards of them before they were
discovered; and then never did horses run nearest their
topmost speed for a stake in dollars than did ours for a
steak of meat. But, alas! the little advantage gained at
the start, from the bewildered {41} inaction of the game,
began to diminish as soon as those fleet coursers of the
prairie laid their nimble hoofs to the sward, and pledged
life upon speed. In this exigency a few balls were sent
whistling after them, but they soon slept in the earth,
instead of the panting hearts they were designed to render
pulseless; and we returned to our lonely and hungry march.</p>

<p>At sunset we encamped on the banks of a branch of the
Arkansas.<a name="FNanchor_38" id="FNanchor_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> Our rations were now reduced to one-eighth of
a pint of flour to each man. This, as our custom was, was
kneaded with water, and baked or rather dried in our
frying-pan, over a fire sufficiently destitute of combustibles
to have satisfied the most fastidious miser in that line.&mdash;Thus
refreshed, and our clothing dried in the wind during
the day, we hugged our rifles to our hearts, and soundly slept.</p>

<p>The sun of the following morning was unusually bright,
the sky cloudless and delightfully blue. These were new
pleasures; for the heavens and the earth had, till that morning,
since our departure from home, scourged us with every
discouragement which the laws of matter could produce.
Now all around us smiled. Dame {42} Nature, a prude<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
though she be, seemed pleased that she had belaboured our
courage with so little success. To add to our joy, a herd
of oxen and mules were feeding and lowing upon the opposite
bank of the stream. They belonged to the Messrs.
Bents, who have a trading post upon the Arkansas. One
of the partners and thirty odd men were on their way to St.
Louis, with ten waggons laden with peltries. They were
also driving down two hundred Santa F&eacute; sheep, for the
Missouri market. These animals are usually purchased
from the Spaniards; and if the Indians prove far enough
from the track so as to permit the purchaser to drive them
into the States, his investment is unusually profitable. The
Indians, too, residing along the Mexican frontier, not infrequently
find it convenient to steal large numbers of mules,
&amp;c., from their no less swarthy neighbours; and from the
ease with which they acquire them, find themselves able and
willing to sell them to traders for a very easily arranged
compensation.</p>

<p>Of these several sources of gain, it would seem the Messrs.
Bents<a name="FNanchor_39" id="FNanchor_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> avail themselves; since, on meeting the gentleman
in charge of the waggons before spoken of, he informed {43}
us that he had lost thirty Mexican mules and seven horses;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>and desired us, as we intended to pass his post, to recover
and take them back. A request of any kind from a white
face in the wilderness is never denied. Accordingly, we
agreed to do as he desired, if within our power.</p>

<p>We made little progress to-day. Our packs, that had
been soaked by storm and stream, required drying, and
for that purpose we went early into camp. The country in
which we now were, was by no means sacred to safety of
life, limb or property. The Pawnee and Cumanche war-parties
roam through it during the spring and summer
months, for plunder and scalps. The guards, which we
had had on the alert since leaving Council Grove, were
therefore carefully stationed at nightfall among the
animals around the tent, and urged to the most careful
watchfulness. But no foe molested us. In the expressive
language of the giant of our band, prefaced always with an
appropriate sigh and arms akimbo, "We were not murdered
yet."</p>

<p>About twelve o'clock of the 14th, we passed the Little
Arkansas.<a name="FNanchor_40" id="FNanchor_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> Our hunters had been there the previous night,
and had succeeded in taking a dozen cat-fish. Their {44}
own keen hunger had devoured a part of them without
pepper, or salt, or bread, or vegetable. The remainder we
found attached to a bush in the stream, in an unwholesome
state of decomposition. They were, however, taken up
and examined by the senses of sight and smell alternately;
and viewed and smelt again in reference to our ravenous
palates; and although some doubt may have existed in
regard to the Hebrew principle of devouring so unclean
a thing, our appetites allowed of no demur. We roasted
and ate, as our companions had done.</p>

<p>I had an opportunity at this place to observe the great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
extent of the rise and fall of these streams of the plains in
a single day or night. It would readily be presumed, by
those who have a correct idea of the floods of water that the
thunder-storms of this region pour upon the rolling prairies,
that a few miles of the channels of a number of the creeks
over which the storms pass may be filled to the brim in
an hour; and that there are phenomena of floods and falls
of water occurring in this vast den of tempests, such as
are found nowhere else. Still, bearing this evidently true
explanation in mind, it was with some {45} difficulty that I
yielded to the evidences on the banks of the Little Arkansas,
that that stream had fallen fifteen feet during the last twelve
hours. It was still too deep for the safety of the pack animals
to attempt to ford it in the usual way. The banks,
also, at the fording-place were left by the retiring flood, a
quagmire; so soft, that a horse without burthen could, with
the greatest difficulty, drag himself through it to the water
below. In our extremity, however, we tied our lashing-lines
together, and, attaching one end to a strong stake on
the side we occupied, sent the other across the stream, and
tied it firmly to a tree. Our baggage, saddles and clothing
suspended to hooks running to and fro on this line, were
securely passed over. The horses being then driven
across at the ill-omened ford, and ourselves over by
swimming and other means, we saddled and loaded our
animals with their several burthens, and recommenced our
march.</p>

<p>The 14th, 15th, and 16th, were days of more than ordinary
hardships. With barely food enough to support life,
drenched daily by thunder-storms and by swimming and
fording the numerous drains of this alluvial {46} region, and
wearied by the continual packing and unpacking of our
animals, and enfeebled by the dampness of my couch at
night, I was so much reduced when I dismounted from my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
horse on the evening of the 16th, that I was unable to loosen
the girth of my saddle or spread my blanket for repose.</p>

<p>The soil thus far from the frontier appeared to be from
three to six feet in depth; generally undulating, and occasionally,
far on the western horizon, broken into ragged and
picturesque bluffs. Between the swells, we occasionally
met small tracts of marshy ground saturated with brackish
water.</p>

<p>On the night of the 16th, near the hour of eight o'clock,
we were suddenly roused by the rapid trampling of animals
near our camp. "Indians!" was the cry of the guard,
"Indians!" We had expected an encounter with them as
we approached the buffalo, and were consequently not
unprepared for it. Each man seized his rifle, and was
instantly in position to give the intruders a proper reception.
On they came, rushing furiously in a dense column
till within thirty yards of our tent; and then wheeling
short to the left, abruptly halted. {47} Not a rifle-ball or
an arrow had yet cleft the air. Nor was it so necessary
that they should; for we discovered that, instead of
bipeds of bloody memory, they were the quadrupeds that
had eloped from the fatherly care of Mr. Bent, making a
call of ceremony upon their compatriot mules, &amp;c., tied to
stakes within our camp.</p>

<p>17th. We were on the trail at seven o'clock. The sun of
a fine morning shone upon our ranks of beasts and men.
Were I able to sketch the woe-shrivelled visages of my starving
men, with occasional bursts of wrath upon Mr. Bent's
mules as they displayed their ungrateful heels to us, who
had restored them from the indecencies of savage life to
the dominion of civilized beings, my readers would say that
the sun never looked upon a more determined disregard
of the usages of social life. A long march before us&mdash;the
Arkansas and its fish before us, the buffalo with all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
the delicate bits of tender loin and marrow bones, (even the
remembrance of them inspires me)&mdash;with all these before
us, who that has the sympathies of the palate sensibilities
within him, can suppose that we did not use the spur, whip
and goad with a right good will on that memorable day?
{48} Thirty or forty miles, none but the vexed plains can tell
which, were travelled over by one o'clock. The afternoon
hours, too, were counted slowly. High bluffs, and butes, and
rolls, and salt marshes alternately appearing and falling
behind us, with here and there a plat of the thick short
grass of the upper plains and the stray bunches of the
branching columnar and foliated prickly pear, indicated
that we were approaching some more important course of
the mountain waters than we had yet seen since leaving
the majestic Missouri. "On, merrily on," rang from our
parched and hungry mouths; and if the cheerful shout did
not allay our appetites or thirst, it quickened the pace of our
mules, and satisfied each other of our determined purpose
to behold the Arkansas by the light of that day.</p>

<p>During the hurried drive of the afternoon we became
separated from one another among the swells over which
our track ran. Two of the advanced platoon took the
liberty, in the absence of their commander, to give chace
to an antelope which seemed to tantalize their forbearance
by exhibiting his fine sirloins to their view. Never did men
better earn forgiveness for disobedience of orders. One
of them crept as I {49} learned half a mile upon his hands
and knees to get within rifle shot of his game;&mdash;shot at
three hundred yards' distance and brought him down! And
now, who, in the tameness of an enough-and-to-spare state
of existence, in which every emotion of the mind is surfeited
and gouty, can estimate our pleasure at seeing these men
gallop into our ranks with this antelope? You may "guess,"
reader, you may "reckon," you may "calculate," or if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
learned in the demi-semi-quavers of modern exquisiteness,
you may thrust rudely aside all these wholesome and fat
old words of the heart, and "shrewdly imagine," and still
you cannot comprehend the feelings of that moment! Did
we shout? were we silent? no, neither. Did we gather
quickly around the horse which bore the slaughtered animal?
No, nor this. An involuntary murmur of relief
from the most fearful forebodings, and the sudden halt of
the riding animals in their tracks were the only movements,
the only acts that indicated our grateful joy at
this deliverance.</p>

<p>Our intention of seeing the Arkansas that night, however,
soon banished every other thought from the mind. Whips
and spurs therefore were freely used upon our animals {50}
as they ascended tediously a long roll of prairies covered
with the wild grasses and stinted stalks of the sun-flower.
We rightly conceived this to be the bordering ridge of the
valley of the Arkansas. For on attaining its summit we
saw ten miles of that stream lying in the sunset like a beautiful
lake among the windings of the hills. It was six miles
distant&mdash;the sun was setting. The road lay over sharp
rolls of land that rendered it nearly impossible for us to keep
our jaded animals on a trot. But the sweet water of that
American Nile, and a copse of timber upon its banks that
offered us the means of cooking the antelope to satisfy our
intolerable hunger, gave us new energy; and on we went at
a rapid pace while sufficient light remained to show us the
trail.<a name="FNanchor_41" id="FNanchor_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a></p>

<p>When within about a mile and a half of the river a
most annoying circumstance crossed our path. A swarm<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
of the most gigantic and persevering musquitoes that ever
gathered tribute from human kind, lighted on us and
demanded blood. Not in the least scrupulous as to the
manner in which they urged their claims, they fixed themselves
boldly and without ceremony upon our organs of
sight, smell, and whipping, {51} in such numbers, that in
consequence of the employment they gave us in keeping
them at the distance, and the pain which they inflicted
upon our restive animals, we lost the trail. And now came
quagmires, flounderings, and mud, such as would have
taught the most hardened rebel in morals that deviations
from the path of duty lead sometimes to pain, sometimes to
swamps. Long perseverance at length enabled us to reach
the great "River of the Plains."</p>

<p>We tarried for a moment upon the banks of the stream
and cast about to extricate ourselves from the Egyptian
plagues around us. To regain our track in the darkness of
night, now mingled with a dense fog, was no easy task. We,
however, took the lead of a swell of land that ran across it,
and in thirty minutes entered a path so well marked that
we could tread our way onward till we should find wood
sufficient to cook our supper. This was a dreary ride. The
stars gave a little light among the mist, which enabled us
to discern, on the even line of the horizon, a small speck
that after three hours' travel we found to be a small grove of
cotton wood upon an island. We encamped near it; and
after our baggage was piled up so {52} as to form a circle
of breastworks for defence, our weariness was such that we
sank among it supperless, and slept with nothing but the
heavens over us. And although we were in the range of
the Cumanche hunting as well as war-parties, the guard
slept in spite of the savage eyes that might be gloating vengeance
on our little band. No fear or war-whoop could
have broken the slumbers of that night. It was a temporary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
death. Nature had made its extreme effort, and sunk in
helplessness till its ebbing energies should reflow.</p>

<p>On the morning of the 18th of June we were up early&mdash;early
around among our animals to pull up the stakes to
which they were tied, and drive them fast again, where they
might graze while we should eat. Then to the care of ourselves.
We wrestled manfully with the frying-pan and
roasting-stick; and anon in the very manner that one sublime
act always follows its predecessor, tore bone from
bone the antelope ribs, with so strong a grip and with such
unrestrained delight that a truly philosophic observer might
have discovered in the flash of our eyes and the quick energetic
motion of the nether portions of our {53} physiognomies,
that eating, though an uncommon, was nevertheless
our favourite occupation.&mdash;Then "catch up," "saddles on,"
"packs on," "mount," "march," were heard on all sides,
and we were on the route, hurry-scurry, with forty loose
mules and horses leering, kicking and braying, and some
six or eight pack animals making every honourable effort
to free themselves from servitude, while we were applying
to their heads and ears certain gentle intimations that such
ambitious views accorded not with their master's wishes.</p>

<p>In the course of the day we crossed several tributaries
of the Arkansas. At one of these, called by the traders
Big Turkey Creek,<a name="FNanchor_42" id="FNanchor_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> we were forced to resort again to our
Chilian bridge. In consequence of the spongy nature of
the soil and the scarcity of timber, we here found more
difficulty in procuring fastenings for our ropes, than in any
previous instance. At length, however, we obtained pieces
of flood-wood, and drove them into the soft banks "at an
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>inclination," said he of the axe, "of precisely 45&deg; to the
plane of the horizon." Thus supported, the stakes stood
sufficiently firm for our purposes; {54} and our bags, packs,
selves, and beasts were over in a trice, and in the half of
that mathematical fraction of time, we were repacked,
remounted, and trotting off at a generous pace, up the
Arkansas. The river appeared quite unlike the streams of
the East, and South, and Southwest portion of the States in
all its qualities. Its banks were low&mdash;one and a half feet
above the medium stage of water, composed of an alluvium
of sand and loam as hard as a public highway, and generally
covered with a species of wiry grass that seldom grows
to more than one and a half or two inches in height. The
sun-flower of stinted growth, and a lonely bush of willow, or
an ill-shaped sapless, cotton-wood tree, whose decayed trunk
trembled under the weight of years, together with occasional
bluffs of clay and sand-stone, formed the only alleviating
features of the landscape. The stream itself was generally
three-quarters of a mile in width, with a current of five
miles per hour, water three and a half to four feet, and of
a chalky whiteness. It was extremely sweet, so delicious
that some of my men declared it an excellent substitute
for milk.</p>

<p>{55} Camped on the bank of the river where the common
tall grass of the prairie grew plentifully; posted our night-guard,
and made a part of our meat into soup for supper.
I will here give a description of the manner of making this
soup. It was indeed a rare dish; and my friends of the
trencher&mdash;ye who have been spiced, and peppered, and
salted, from your youth up, do not sneer when I declare
that of all the innovations upon kitchen science which
civilization has engrafted upon the good old style of the
patriarchs, nothing has produced so depraving an effect
upon taste, as these self-same condiments of salt, pepper, &amp;c.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
But to our soup. It was made of simple meat and water&mdash;of
pure water, such as kings drank from the streams
of the good old land of pyramids and flies, and of the wild
meat of the wilderness, untainted with any of the aforesaid
condiments&mdash;simply boiled, and then eaten with strong,
durable iron spoons and butcher-knives. Here I cannot
restrain from penning one strong and irrepressible emotion
that I well remember to have experienced while stretched
upon my couch after our repast. The exceeding comfort
of body and mind {56} at that moment undoubtedly gave
it being. It was an emotion of condolence for those of
my fellow mortals who are engaged in the manufacture
of rheumatisms and gout. Could they only for an hour
enter the portals of prairie life&mdash;for one hour breathe the
inspiration of a hunter's transcendentalism&mdash;for one hour
feed upon the milk and honey and marrow of life's pure
unpeppered and unsalted viands, how soon would they
forsake that ignoble employment&mdash;how soon would their
hissing and vulgar laboratories of disease and graves be
forsaken, and the crutch and Brandreth's pills be gathered
to the tombs of our fathers!</p>

<p>Our next day's march terminated in an encampment
with the hunters whom I had sent forward for game. They
had fared even worse than ourselves. Four of the
seven days they had been absent from the company,
and had been without food. Many of the streams, too,
that were forded easily by us, were, when they passed, wide
and angry floods. These they were obliged to swim, to
the great danger of their lives.</p>

<p>On the 18th, however, they overtook Messrs. Walworth
and Alvarez's teams,<a name="FNanchor_43" id="FNanchor_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> {57} and were treated with great
hospitality by those gentlemen. On the same day they
killed a buffalo bull, pulled off the flesh from the back, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>commenced drying it over a slow fire preparatory to packing.
On the morning of the 19th, two of them started off for us
with some strips of meat dangling over the shoulders of
their horses. They met us about four o'clock, and with us
returned to the place of drying the meat. Our horses were
turned loose to eat the dry grass, while we feasted ourselves
upon roasted tongue and liver. After this we "caught up"
and went on with the intention of encamping with the Santa
F&eacute;&auml;ns; after travelling briskly onward for two hours, we
came upon the brow of a hill that overlooks the valley of
Pawnee Fork, the largest branch of the Arkansas on its
northern side. The Santa F&eacute; traders had encamped on
the east bank of the stream. The waggons surrounded an
oval piece of ground, their shafts or tongues outside, and
the forward wheel of each abreast of the hind wheel of the
one before it. This arrangement gave them a fine aspect,
when viewed from the hill, over which we were passing.</p>

<p>But we had scarcely time to see the {58} little I described,
when a terrific scream of "Pawnee! Pawnee!" arose from
a thousand tongues on the farther bank of the river; and
Indian women and children ran and shrieked horribly,
"Pawnee! Pawnee!" as they sought the glens and bushes
of the neighbourhood. We were puzzled to know the
object of such an outburst of savage delight, as we deemed
it to be, and for a time thought that we might well expect
our blood to slumber with the buffalo, whose bones lay
bleaching around us. The camp of the traders also was in
motion; arms were seized and horses saddled with "hot
haste." A moment more, and two whites were galloping
warily near us; a moment more brought twenty savage
warriors in full paint and plume around us. A quick
reconnoitre, and the principal chief rode briskly up to me,
shook me warmly by the hand, and with a clearly apparent
friendship said "Sacre f&#339;dus" (holy league,) "Kauzaus,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
"Caw." His warriors followed his example. As soon as
our friendly greetings were discovered by some of the minor
chiefs, they galloped their fleet horses at full speed over the
river, and the women and children issued from their concealments,
and lined the bank with their dusky forms. The
chiefs rode {59} with us to our camping ground, and remained
till dark, examining with great interest the various articles
of our travelling equipage; and particularly our tent as it
unfolded its broadsides like magic, and assumed the form
of a solid white cone. Every arrangement being made to
prevent these accomplished thieves from stealing our horses,
&amp;c., we supped, and went to make calls upon our neighbours.</p>

<p>The owners of the Santa F&eacute; waggons were men who had
seen much of life. Urbane and hospitable, they received
us in the kindest manner, and gave us much information
in regard to the mountains, the best mode of defence, &amp;c.,
that proved in our experience remarkably correct. During
the afternoon, the chiefs of the Kauzaus sent me a number
of buffalo tongues, and other choice bits of meat. But the
filth discoverable on their persons generally deterred us
from using them. For this they cared little. If their
presents were accepted, an obligation was by their laws
incurred on our part, from which we could only be relieved
by presents in return. To this rule of Indian etiquette we
submitted; and a council was accordingly held between
myself and the principal chief through an interpreter, {60}
to determine upon the amount and quality of my indebtedness
in this regard. The final arrangement was, that in
consideration of the small amount of property I had then
in possession, I would give him two pounds of tobacco, a
side-knife, and a few papers of vermillion; but that, on my
return, which would be in fourteen months, I should be
very rich, and give him more. To all these obligations<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
and pleasant prophecies, I of course gave my most hearty
concurrence.</p>

<p>The Caws, or Kauzaus, are notorious thieves. We
therefore put out a double guard at night, to watch their
predatory operations, with instructions to fire upon them,
if they attempted to take our animals. Neither guard nor
instructions, however, proved of use; for the tempest,
which the experienced old Santa F&eacute;&auml;ns had seen in the
heavens, thunder-cloud in the north-west at sunset, proved
a more efficient protection than the arm of man. The cloud
rose slowly during the early part of the night, and appeared
to hang in suspense of executing its awful purpose. The
lightning and heavy rumbling of the thunder were frightful.
It came to the zenith about twelve o'clock. When in that
position, the cloud covered one-half the heavens, and for
{61} some minutes was nearly stationary. After this, the
wind broke forth upon it at the horizon, and rolled up the
dark masses over our heads&mdash;now swelling, now rending
to shreds its immense folds. But as yet not a breath of air
moved over the plains. The animals stood motionless and
silent at the spectacle. The nucleus of electricity was at
the zenith, and thence large bolts at last leaped in every
direction, and lighted for an instant the earth and skies so
intensely, that the eye could not endure the brightness. The
report which followed was appalling. The ground trembled&mdash;the
horses and mules shook with fear, and attempted
to escape. But where could they or ourselves have found
shelter? The clouds at the next moment appeared in the
wildest commotion, struggling with the wind. "Where
shall we fly?" could scarcely have been spoken, before the
wind struck our tent, tore the stakes from the ground,
snapped the centre pole, and buried us in its enraged folds.
Every man, we were thirteen in number, immediately seized
some portion and held it with all his might. Our opinion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
at the time was, that the absence of the weight of a single
man would have given the storm the victory&mdash;our tent
would have eloped in the {62} iron embraces of the tempest.
We attempted to fit it up again after the violence of the
storm had in some degree passed over, but were unable
so to do. The remainder of the night was consequently
spent in gathering up our loose animals, and in shivering
under the cold peltings of the rain.</p>

<p>The Santa F&eacute;&auml;ns, when on march through these plains,
are in constant expectation of these tornadoes. Accordingly,
when the sky at night indicates their approach, they chain
the wheels of adjacent waggons strongly together to prevent
them from being upset&mdash;an accident that has often happened,
when this precaution was not taken. It may well
be conceived, too, that to prevent their goods from being
wet in such cases, requires a covering of no ordinary powers
of protection. Bows in the usual form, except that they
are higher, are raised over long sunken Pennsylvania
waggons, over which are spread two or three thicknesses
of woollen blankets; and over these, and extended to the
lower edge of the body, is drawn a strong canvas covering,
well guarded with cords and leather straps. Through this
covering these tempests seldom penetrate.</p>

<p>At seven o'clock on the morning of the 27th, "Catch up,
catch up," rang round {63} the waggons of the Santa F&eacute;&auml;ns.
Immediately each man had his hand upon a horse or mule;
and ere we, in attempting to follow their example, had our
horses by the halter, the teams were harnessed and ready
for the "march." A noble sight those teams were, about
forty in number, their immense waggons still unmoved,
forming an oval breastwork of wealth, girded by an impatient
mass of near four hundred mules, harnessed and
ready to move again along their solitary way. But the
interest of the scene was much increased when, at the call<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
of the commander, the two lines, team after team, straightened
themselves into the trail, and rode majestically away
over the undulating plain. We crossed the Pawnee Fork,<a name="FNanchor_44" id="FNanchor_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a>
and visited the Caw Camp. Their wigwams were constructed
of bushes inserted into the ground, twisted together
at the top, and covered with the buffalo hides which they
had been gathering for their winter lodges. Meat was
drying in every direction. It had been cut in long narrow
strips, wound around sticks standing upright in the ground,
or laid over a rick of wicker-work, under which slow fires are
kept burning. The stench, and the squalid appearance of
the women and children, {64} were not sufficiently interesting
to detain us long; and we travelled on for the buffalo
which were bellowing over the hills in advance of us.
There appeared to be about one thousand five hundred
souls, almost in a state of nudity, and filthy as swine.
They make a yearly hunt to this region in the spring, lay
in a large quantity of dried meat, return to their own
territory in harvest time, gather their beans and corn, make
the buffalo hides, (taken before the hair is long enough for
robes), into conical tents, and thus prepare for a long and
merry winter.</p>

<p>They take with them, on these hunting excursions, all the
horses and mules belonging to the tribe, which can be
spared from the labour of their fields upon the Konzas
River, go south till they meet the buffalo, build their distant
wigwams, and commence their labour. This is divided in
the following manner between the males, females, and
children:&mdash;The men kill the game. The women dress and
dry the meat, and tan the hides. The instruments used
in killing vary with the rank and wealth of each individual.
The high chief has a lance, with a handle six feet and blade
three feet in length. This in hand, mounted {65} upon a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
fleet horse, he rides boldly to the side of the flying buffalo,
and thrusts it again and again through the liver or heart of
one, and then another of the affrighted herd till his horse
is no longer able to keep near them. He is thus able to kill
five or six, more or less, at a single hit. Some of the
inferior chiefs also have these lances; but they must all be
shorter than that of his Royal Darkness. The common
Indians use muskets and pistols. Rifles are an abomination
to them. The twisting motion of the ball as it enters,
the sharp crack when discharged, and the direful singing
of the lead as it cuts the air, are considered symptoms of
witchcraft that are unsafe for the Red Man to meddle with.
They call them medicines&mdash;inscrutable and irresistible
sources of evil. The poorer classes still use the bow and
arrow. Nor is this, in the well-trained hand of the Indian,
a less effective weapon than those already mentioned.
Astride a good horse, beside a bellowing band of wild beef,
leaning forward upon the neck, and drawing his limbs close
to the sides of his horse, the naked hunter uses his national
weapon with astonishing dexterity and success. Not unfrequently,
when hitting no bones, does he throw his arrows
quite through the buffalo. Twenty {66} or thirty thus variously
armed, advance upon a herd. The chief leads the
chase, and by the time they come alongside the band, the
different speed of the horses has brought them into a single
file or line. Thus they run until every individual has a
buffalo at his side. Then the whole line fire guns, throw
arrows or drive lances, as often and as long as the speed of
the horses will allow; and seldom do they fail in encounters
of this kind, to lay upon the dusty plain numbers of these
noble animals.</p>

<p>A cloud of squaws who had been hovering in the neighbourhood,
now hurry up, astride of pack-animals, strip off
hides, cut off the best flesh, load their pack saddles, mount<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
themselves on the top, and move slowly away to the camp.
The lords of creation have finished their day's labour. The
<i>ladies</i> cure the meat in the manner described above, stretch
the hides upon the ground, and with a blunt wooden adze
hew them into leather. The younger shoots of the tribe
during the day are engaged in watering and guarding the
horses and mules that have been used in the hunt&mdash;changing
their stakes from one spot to another of fresh grass,
and crouching along the heights around the camp to notice
the approach of {67} foes, and sound the alarm. Thus
the Konzas, Kausaus, or Caws, lay in their annual stores.
Unless driven from their game by the Pawnees, or some
other tribe at enmity with them, they load every animal
with meat and hides about the first of August, and commence
the march back to their fields, fathers, and wigwams,
on the Konzas River.</p>

<p>This return-march must present a most interesting scene
in savage life&mdash;seven hundred or eight hundred horses or
mules loaded with the spoils of the chase, and the children
of the tribe holding on to the pack with might and main,
naked as eels, and shining with buffalo grease, their fathers
and mothers loafing on foot behind, with their guns poised
on the left arm, or their bows and arrows swung at their
back ready for action, and turning their heads rapidly and
anxiously for lurking enemies&mdash;the attack, the screams of
women and children, each man seizing an animal for a
breastwork, and surrounding thus their wives and children,
the firing, the dying, the conquest, the whoop of victory and
rejoicings of one party, and the dogged, sullen submission
of the other&mdash;all this and more has occurred a thousand
times upon {68} these plains, and is still occurring. But if
victory declare for the Caws, or they march to their home
without molestation, how many warm affections spring up
in their untamed bosoms, as they see again their parents<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
and children, and the ripened harvest, the woods, the streams,
and bubbling springs, among which the gleeful days of
childhood were spent! And when greetings are over, and
welcomes are said, embraces exchanged, and their homes
seen and smiled upon; in fine, when all the holy feelings of
remembrance, and their present good fortune, find vent in
the wild night-dance, who, that wears a white skin and ponders
upon the better lot of civilized men, will not believe
that the Indian too, returned from the hunt and from war,
has not as much happiness, if not in kind the same, and as
many sentiments that do honour to our nature, as are
wrapped in the stays and tights of a fantastic, mawkish
civilization&mdash;that flattering, pluming, gormandizing, unthinking,
gilded life, which is beginning to measure mental
and moral worth by the amount of wealth possessed, and
the adornment of a slip or pew in church.</p>

<p>We travelled eight miles and encamped. {69} A band of
buffalo cows were near us. In other words, we were determined
upon a hunt&mdash;a determination the consequences of
which, as will hereafter appear were highly disastrous.
Our tent having been pitched, and baggage piled up, the
fleetest horses selected, and the best marksmen best mounted,
we trotted slowly along a circling depression of the plain,
that wound around near the herd on the leeward side.
When we emerged in sight of them, we put the horses into
a slow gallop till within three hundred yards of our game;
and then for the nimblest heel! Each was at his utmost
speed. We all gained upon the herd. But two of the
horses were by the side of the lubbers before the rest were
within rifle-reach; and the rifles and pistols of their riders
discharged into the sleek, well-larded body of a noble bull.
The wounded animal did not drop; the balls had entered
neither liver nor heart; and away he ran for his life. But
his unwieldy form moved slower and slower, as the dripping<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
blood oozed from the bullet-holes in his loins. He ran
towards our tent; and we followed him in that direction,
till within a fourth of a mile of it, when our heroes of
the rifle laid him wallowing in his blood, a mountain of
flesh {70} weighing at least three thousand pounds. We
butchered him in the following manner: Having turned
him upon his brisket, split the skin above the spine, and
pared it off as far down the sides as his position would
allow, we cut off the flesh that lay outside the ribs as
far back as the loins. This the hunters call "the fleece."
We next took the ribs that rise perpendicularly from
the spine between the shoulders, and support what is
termed the "hump." Then we laid our heavy wood-axes
upon the enormous side-ribs, opened a cavity, and took out
the tender-loins, tallow, &amp;c.,&mdash;all this a load for two
mules to carry into camp.</p>

<p>It was prepared for packing as follows: the fleece was
cut across the grain into slices an eighth of an inch in thickness,
and spread upon a scaffolding of poles, and dried and
smoked over a slow fire. While we were engaged in this
process, information came that three of Mr. Bent's mules
had escaped. The probability was that they had gone
to the guardianship of our neighbours, the Caws. This was
a misfortune to our honourable intention of restoring them
to their lawful owners. Search was immediately ordered
in the Indian camp and elsewhere for them. It was {71}
fruitless. The men returned with no very favourable
account of their reception by the Caws, and were of opinion
that farther search would be in vain. Being disposed to
try my influence with the principal chief, I gave orders to
raise the camp and follow the Santa F&eacute;ans, without reference
to my return, and mounting my horse, in company with
three men, sought his lodge. The wigwams were deserted,
save by a few old women and squalid children, who were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
wallowing in dirt and grease, and regaling themselves upon
the roasted intestines of the buffalo. I inquired for the
chiefs, for the mules, whether they themselves were human
or bestial; for, on this point, there was room for doubt: to all
which inquiries, they gave an appropriate grunt. But no
chief or other person could be found, on whom any responsibility
could be thrown in regard to the lost mules. And
after climbing the heights to view the plains, and riding
from band to band of His Darkness's quadrupeds for three
hours in vain, we returned to our camp sufficiently vexed
for all purposes of comfort.</p>

<p>Yet this was only the beginning of the misfortunes of the
day. During my absence, one of those petty bickerings, so
common {72} among men released from the restraints of
society and law, had arisen between two of the most quarrelsome
of the company, terminating in the accidental
wounding of one of them. It occurred, as I learned in the
following manner: a dispute arose between the parties as to
their relative moral honesty in some matter, thing, or act in
the past. And as this was a question of great perplexity in
their own minds, and doubt in those of others, words ran
high and abusive, till some of the men, more regardful of
their duty than these warriors, began preparations to strike
the tent. The redoubtable combatants were within it; and
as the cords were loosed, and its folds began to swing upon
the centre pole, the younger of the braves, filled with wrath
at his opponent, attempted to show how terrible his ire
would be if once let loose among his muscles. For this purpose,
it would seem he seized the muzzle of his rifle with
every demonstration of might, &amp;c., and attempted to drag
it from among the baggage. The hammer of the lock
caught, and sent the contents of the barrel into his side.
Every thing was done for the wounded man that his condition
required, and our circumstances permitted. Doctor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
Walworth, {73} of the Santa F&eacute; caravan, then eight miles in
advance, returned, examined, and dressed the wound, and
furnished a carriage for the invalid. During the afternoon
the high chief of the Caws also visited us; and by introducing
discoloured water into the upper orifice, and watching its
progress through, ascertained that the ball had not entered
the cavity. But notwithstanding that our anxieties about
the life of Smith<a name="FNanchor_45" id="FNanchor_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a> were much lessened by the assurances of
Dr. Walworth, and our friend the Chief, yet we had others
of no less urgent nature, on which we were called to act.
We were on the hunting-ground of the Caws. They were
thieves; and after the Santa F&eacute; traders should have left the
neighbourhood, they would without scruple use their superior
force in appropriating to themselves our animals,
and other means of continuing our journey. The Pawnees,
too, were daily expected. The Cumanches were prowling
about the neighbourhood. To remain, therefore, in our
present encampment, until Smith could travel without
pain and danger, was deemed certain death to all. To
travel on in a manner as comfortable to the invalid, as our
{74} condition would permit&mdash;painful to him and tedious
to us though it should be&mdash;appeared therefore the only
means of safety to all, or any of us. We accordingly covered
the bottom of the carriole with grass and blankets, laid
Smith upon them, and with other blankets bolstered him
in such manner that the jolting of the carriage would not
roll him. Other arrangements necessary to raising camp
being made, I gave the company in charge of my lieutenant;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>and ordering him to lead on after me as fast as possible,
took the reins of the carriage and drove slowly along the
trail of the Santa F&eacute;&auml;ns.</p>

<p>The trail was continually crossed by deep paths made
by the buffalo, as a thousand generations of them had in
single file followed their leaders from point to point through
the plains. These, and other obstructions, jolted the carriage
at every step, and caused the wounded man to groan
pitiably. I drove on till the stars indicated the hour of
midnight; and had hoped by this time to have overtaken
the traders, but was disappointed. In vain I looked through
the darkness for the white embankment of their waggons.
The soil over which they had passed was {75} now so hard,
that the man in advance of the carriage could no longer
find the trail; and another storm was crowding its dark pall
up the western sky. The thunder aroused and enraged
the buffalo bulls. They pawed the earth and bellowed, and
gathered around the carriage madly, as if they considered
it a huge animal of their own species, uttering thunder in
defiance of them. It became dangerous to move. It was
useless also; for the darkness thickened so rapidly that we
could not keep the track. My men, too, had not come up;
they had doubtless lost the trail&mdash;or, if not, might join
me if I waited there till the morning. I therefore halted
in a deep ravine, which would partially protect me from
the maddened buffalo and the storm, tied down my animals
head to foot, and sought rest. Smith was in great pain.
His groans were sufficient to prevent sleep. But had he
been comfortable and silent, the storm poured such torrents
of rain and hail, with terrible wind and lightning,
around us, that life instead of repose became the object of
our solicitude. The horseman who had accompanied me,
had spread his blankets on the ground under the carriage,
and, {76} with his head upon his saddle, attempted to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
disregard the tempest as an old-fashioned stoic would the
toothache. But it beat too heavy for his philosophy. His
Mackinaw blankets and slouched hat, for a time protected
his ungainly body from the effects of the tumbling flood.
But when the water began to stream through the bottom of
the carriage upon him, the ire of the animal burst from his
lank cheeks like the coming of a rival tempest. He cursed
his stars, and the stars behind the storm, his garters, and the
garters of some female progenitor, consigned to purgatory
the thunder, lightning, and rain, and waggon, alias poor
Smith; and gathering up the shambling timbers of his
mortal frame, raised them bolt upright in the storm, and
thus stood, quoted Shakspeare, and ground his teeth till
daylight.</p>

<p>As soon as day dawned I found the trail again, and at
seven o'clock overtook the Santa F&eacute;&auml;ns. Having changed
Smith's bedding, I drove on in the somewhat beaten track
that forty odd waggons made. Still every small jolt caused
the unfortunate man to scream with pain. The face of
the country around Pawnee Fork was, when we saw it, {77}
a picture of beauty. The stream winds silently among
bluffs covered with woods, while from an occasional ravine,
long groves stretch out at right angles with its main course
into the bosom of the plains. The thousand hills that
swelled on the horizon, were covered with dark masses of
buffalo peacefully grazing, or quenching their thirst at the
sweet streams among them. But the scene had now changed.
No timber, not a shrub was seen to-day. The soft rich
soil had given place to one of flint and sand, as hard as
M'Adam's pavements; the green, tall prairie grass, to a
dry, wiry species, two inches in height. The water, too,
disgusting remembrance! There was none, save what we
scooped from the puddles, thick and yellow with buffalo
offal.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span></p>

<p>We travelled fifteen miles, and halted for the night. Smith
was extremely unwell. His wound was much inflamed and
painful. Dr. Walworth dressed it, and encouraged me
to suppose that no danger of life was to be apprehended.
My company joined me at twelve o'clock, on the 22nd,
and we followed in the rear of the cavalcade. After
supper was over, and Smith made comfortable, {78} I sought
from some of them a relation of their fortunes during
the past night. It appeared they had found the buffalo
troublesome as soon as night came on; that the bands of
bulls not unfrequently advanced in great numbers within
a few feet of them, pawing and bellowing in the most
threatening manner; that they also lost the trail after midnight,
and spent the remainder of the night in firing upon
the buffalo, to keep them from running over them. Their
situation was dangerous in the extreme; for when buffalo
become enraged, or frightened in any considerable number,
and commence running, the whole herd start simultaneously,
and pursue nearly a right-line course, regardless of
obstacles. So that, had they been frightened by the Santa
F&eacute;&auml;ns, or myself, or any other cause, in the direction of
my companions, they must have trampled them to death.
The danger to be apprehended from such an event, was
rendered certain in the morning, when we perceived that
the whole circle of vision was one black mass of these
animals. What a sea of life&mdash;of muscular power&mdash;of
animal appetite&mdash;of bestial enjoyment! And if lashed
to rage by some pervading cause, how fearful {79} the
ebbing and flowing of its mighty wrath!</p>

<p>On the 23rd the buffalo were more numerous than ever.
They were arranged in long lines from the eastern to the
western horizon. The bulls were forty or fifty yards in
advance of the bands of cows to which they severally intended
to give protection. And as the moving embankment<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
of waggons, led by the advanced guard, and flanked by
horsemen riding slowly from front to rear, and guarded in
the rear by my men, made its majestic way along, these
fiery cavaliers would march each to his own band of dames
and misses, with an air that seemed to say "we are here;"
and then back again to their lines, with great apparent satisfaction,
that they were able to do battle for their sweet ones
and their native plains. We travelled fifteen or sixteen
miles; distance usually made in a day by the traders.
Smith's wound was more inflamed and painful; the wash
and salve of the Indian chief, however, kept it soft, and
prevented to a great extent the natural inflammation of the
case.</p>

<p>The face of the country was still an arid plain&mdash;the water
as on the 22nd&mdash;fuel, dried {80} buffalo offal&mdash;not a shrub
of any kind in sight. Another storm occurred to-night.
Its movements were more rapid than that of any preceding
one which we had experienced. In a few moments after
it showed its dark outline above the earth, it rolled its pall
over the whole sky, as if to build a wall of wrath between
us and the mercies of heaven. The flash of the lightning,
as it bounded upon the firmament, and mingled its thunder
with the blast, that came groaning down from the mountains;
the masses of inky darkness crowding in wild tumult
along, as if anxious to lead the leaping bolt upon us&mdash;the
wild world of buffalo, bellowing and starting in myriads, as
the drapery of this funeral scene of nature, a vast cavern
of fire was lighted up; the rain roaring and foaming like a
cataract&mdash;all this, a reeling world tottering under the great
arm of its Maker, no eye could see and be unblenched; no
mind conceive, and keep its clayey tenement erect.</p>

<p>I drew the carriole in which Smith and myself were
attempting to sleep, close to the Santa F&eacute; waggons, secured
the curtains as firmly as I was able to do, spread blankets<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
over the top and around the sides, and {81} lashed them
firmly with ropes passing over, under, and around the carriage
in every direction; but to little use. The penetrating
powers of that storm were not resisted by such means.
Again we were thoroughly drenched. The men in the tent
fared still worse than ourselves. It was blown down with
the first blast; and the poor fellows were obliged to lie
closely and hold on strongly to prevent it and themselves
from a flight less safe than parachuting.</p>

<p>On the morning of the 24th, having given Smith in charge
of my excellent Lieutenant, with assurance that I would
join him at the "Crossings," I left them with the traders,
and started with the remainder of my company for the
Arkansas.</p>

<p>The buffalo during the last three days had covered the
whole country so completely, that it appeared oftentimes
extremely dangerous even for the immense cavalcade of the
Santa F&eacute; traders to attempt to break its way through them.
We travelled at the rate of fifteen miles a day. The length
of sight on either side of the trail, 15 miles; on both sides,
30 miles:&mdash;15&times;3=45&times;30=1,350 square miles of {82} country,
so thickly covered with these noble animals, that when
viewed from a height, it scarcely afforded a sight of a square
league of its surface. What a quantity of food for the sustenance
of the Indian and the white pilgrim of these plains!
It would have been gratifying to have seen the beam kick
over the immense frames of some of those bulls. But all
that any of us could do, was to 'guess' or 'reckon' their
weight, and contend about the indubitable certainty of
our several suppositions. In these disputes, two butchers
took the lead; and the substance of their discussions that
could interest the reader is, "that many of the large bulls
would weigh 3,000 pounds and upwards; and that, as a
general rule, the buffalo were much larger and heavier than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
the domesticated cattle of the States." We were in view
of the Arkansas at four o'clock, <span class="smcap">P. M.</span> The face of the earth
was visible again; for the buffalo were now seen in small
herds only, fording the river, or feeding upon the bluffs.
Near nightfall we killed a young bull, and went into
camp for the night.</p>

<p>On the 25th we moved slowly along up the bank of the
river. Having travelled {83} ten miles, one of the men shot
an antelope, and we went into camp, to avoid if possible
another storm that was lowering upon us from the north-west;
but in spite of this precaution, we were again most
uncomfortably drenched.</p>

<p>On the 26th we struck across a southern bend in the
river, and made the Santa F&eacute; "Crossings" at four o'clock,
<span class="smcap">P. M.</span>; 27th. we lay at the "Crossings," waiting for the Santa
F&eacute;&auml;ns, and our wounded companion.<a name="FNanchor_46" id="FNanchor_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a> On this day a
mutiny, which had been ripening ever since Smith was
wounded, assumed a clear aspect. It now appeared that
certain individuals of my company had determined to leave
Smith to perish in the encampment where he was shot;
but failing in supporters of so barbarous a proposition,
they now endeavoured to accomplish their design by less
objectionable means. They said it was evident, if Smith
remained in the company, it must be divided; for that they,
pure creatures, could no longer associate with so impure a
man. And that, in order to preserve the unity of the company,
they would propose that arrangements should be
made with the Santa F&eacute;&auml;ns to take him along with them.
{84} In this wish a majority of the company, induced by a
laudable desire for peace, and the preservation of our small
force entire, in a country filled with Indian foes, readily
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>united. I was desired to make the arrangement; but my
efforts proved fruitless. The traders were of the opinion that
it would be hazardous for Smith, destitute of the means of
support, to trust himself among a people of whose language
he was ignorant, and among whom he could consequently
get no employment; farther, that Smith had a right to
expect protection from his comrades; and they would not,
by any act of theirs, relieve them from so sacred a duty.
I reported to my company this reply, and dwelt at length
upon the reasons assigned by the traders.</p>

<p>The mutineers were highly displeased with the strong
condemnation contained in them, of their intention to desert
him; and boldly proposed to leave Smith in the carriole,
and secretly depart for the mountains. Had we done this
inhuman act, I have no doubt that he would have been
treated with great humanity and kindness, till he should
have recovered from his wound. But the meanness of the
proposition to leave a sick companion {85} on the hands of
those who had shown us unbounded kindness, and in violation
of the solemn agreement we had all entered into on the
frontier of Missouri&mdash;"to protect each other to the last
extremity"&mdash;was so manifest, as to cause C. Wood, Jourdan,
Oakley, J. Wood, and Blair, to take open and strong
grounds against it. They declared, that "however unworthy
Smith might be, we could neither leave him to be
eaten by wolves, nor to the mercy of strangers; and that
neither should be done while they had life to prevent it."</p>

<p>Having thus ascertained that I could rely upon the cooperation
of these men, two of the company made a litter,
on which the unfortunate man might be borne between two
mules. In the afternoon of the 28th, I went down to the
traders, five miles below us, to bring him up to my camp.
The traders generously refused to receive anything for the
use of their carriage, and furnished Smith, when he left them,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
with every little comfort in their power for his future use.
It was past sunset when we left their camp. Deep darkness
soon set in, and we lost our course among the winding bluffs.
{86} But as I had reason to suppose that my presence in the
camp the next morning with Smith was necessary to his
welfare, I drove on till three o'clock in the morning. It was
of no avail: the darkness hid heaven and earth from view.
We therefore halted, tied the mules to the wheels of the carriage,
and waited for the sight of morning. When it came,
we found that we had travelled during the night at one
time up and at another time down the stream, and were
then within a mile and a half of the trader's camp.</p>

<p>On reaching my encampment, I found every thing ready
for marching, sent back the carriole to its owners, and attempted
to swing Smith in his litter for the march; but to
our great disappointment, it would not answer the purpose.
How it was possible to convey him, appeared an inquiry of
the most painful importance. We deliberated long; but
an impossibility barred every attempt to remove its difficulties.
We had no carriage; we could not carry him upon
our shoulders; it seemed impossible for him to ride on
horseback; the mutineers were mounted; the company was
afraid to stay longer in the vicinity of the Cumanche Indians,
{87} with so many animals to tempt them to take our lives;
the Santa F&eacute; waggons were moving over the hills ten miles
away on the other side of the river; I had adjured the
command, and had no control over the movements of the
company; two of the individuals who had declared for
mercy towards Smith had gone with the traders;<a name="FNanchor_47" id="FNanchor_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> there was
but one course left&mdash;one effort that could be made; he
must attempt to ride an easy, gentle mule. If that failed,
those who had befriended him would not then forsake him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span></p>

<p>About eleven o'clock, therefore, on the 29th, Smith being
carefully mounted on a pacing mule, our faces were turned
to Bent's trading post, one hundred and sixty miles up the
Arkansas. One of the principal mutineers, a hard-faced
villain of no honest memory among the traders upon the
Platte, assumed to guide and command. His malice towards
Smith was of the bitterest character, and he had an
opportunity now of making it felt. With a grin upon his
long and withered physiognomy, that shadowed out the
fiendish delight of a heart long incapable of better emotions,
he drove off at a rate which none but a man in health could
have long endured. His motive {88} for this was easily
understood. If we fell behind, he would get rid of the
wounded man, whose presence seemed to be a living evidence
of his murderous intentions, thwarted and cast back
blistering upon his already sufficiently foul character. He
would, also, if rid of those persons who had devoted themselves
to saving him, be able to induce a large number of
the remainder of the company to put themselves under his
especial guardianship in their journey through the mountains;
and if we should be destroyed by the Cumanche
Indians who were prowling around our way, the blackness
of his heart might be hidden, awhile at least, from the world.</p>

<p>The rapid riding, and the extreme warmth, well-nigh
prostrated the remaining strength of the invalid. He
fainted once, and had nearly fallen headlong to the ground;
but all this was delight to the self-constituted leader; and
on he drove, belabouring his own horse unmercifully to
keep up the pace; and quoting Richard's soliloquy with a
satisfaction and emphasis, which seemed to say "the winter"
of <i>his</i> discontent had passed away, as well as that of his
ancient prototype in villany.</p>

<p>{89} The buffalo were seldom seen during the day: the
herds now becoming fewer and smaller. Some of the men,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
when it was near night, gave chase to a small band near
the track, and succeeded in killing a young bull. A fine
fresh steak, and night's rest, cheered the invalid for the
fatigues of a long ride the following day. And a long one
it was. Twenty-five miles under a burning sun, with a
high fever, and three broken ribs, required the greatest
attention from his friends, and the exertion of the utmost
remaining energies of the unfortunate man. Base though
he was in everything that makes a man estimable and valuable
to himself and others, Smith was really an object of
pity and the most assiduous care. His couch was spread&mdash;his
cup of water fresh from the stream, was always by
his side&mdash;and his food prepared in the most palatable
manner which our circumstances permitted. Everything
indeed that his friends (no, not his friends, for he was
incapacitated to attach either the good or the bad to his
person, but those who commiserated his condition), could
do, was done to make him comfortable.</p>

<p>In connexion with this kindness bestowed {90} on Smith,
should be repeated the name of Blair, an old mechanic
from Missouri, who joined my company at the Crossings
of the Arkansas. A man of a kinder heart never existed.
From the place where he joined us to Oregon Territory,
when I or others were worn with fatigue, or disease, or
starvation, he was always ready to administer whatever
relief was in his power. But towards Smith in his helpless
condition he was especially obliging. He dressed his
wound daily. He slept near him at night, and rose to
supply his least want. And in all the trying difficulties
that occurred along our perilous journey, it was his greatest
delight to diffuse peace, comfort, and contentment, to the
extent of his influence. I can never forget the good old
man. He had been cheated out of his property by a near
relative of pretended piety, and had left the chosen scenes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
of his toils and hopes in search of a residence in the wilderness
beyond the mountains. For the purpose of getting to
the Oregon Territory, he had hired himself to a gentleman
of the traders' caravan, with the intention of going to the
country by the way of New Mexico and California. An
honest man&mdash;an honourable {91} man&mdash;a benevolent,
kind, sympathizing friend&mdash;he deserves well of those who
may have the good fortune to become acquainted with
his unpretending worth.<a name="FNanchor_48" id="FNanchor_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a></p>

<p>On the 30th, twenty-five miles up the river.&mdash;This morning
the miscreant who acted as leader exchanged horses,
that he might render it more difficult for Smith to keep in
company. During the entire day's march, Shakspeare
was on the tapis. If there be ears of him about the ugly
world, to hear his name bandied by boobies, and his immortal
verse mangled by barbarians in civilized clothing, those
ears stood erect, and his dust crawled with indignation, as
this savage in nature and practice discharged from his
polluted mouth the inspirations of his genius.</p>

<p>The face of the country was such as that found ever since
we struck the river. Long sweeping bluffs swelled away
from the water's edge into the boundless plains. The
soil was a composition of sand, clay, and gravel&mdash;the only
vegetation&mdash;the short furzy grass, several kinds of prickly
pear, a stinted growth of sun-flower, and a few decrepid
cotton-wood trees on the margin of the stream. The south
side of the river {92} was blackened by the noisy buffalo.
It was amusing when our trail led us near the bank, to observe
the rising wrath of the bulls. They would walk with
a stately tread upon the verge of the bank, at times almost
yelling out their rage, and trampling, pawing, falling upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
their knees, and tearing the earth with their horns; till, as if
unable to keep down the safety-valve of their courage any
longer, they would tumble into the stream, and thunder,
and wade, and swim, and whip the waters with their tails,
and thus throw off a quantity of their bravery. But, like
the wrath and courage of certain members of the biped
race, these manifestations were not bullet proof, for the
crack of a rifle, and the snug fit of a bullet about their
ribs operated instantaneously as an anodyne to all such
like nervous excitation.</p>

<p>We pitched our tent at night near the river. There was
no timber near; but after a long and tedious search we
gathered fire-wood enough to make our evening fire.</p>

<p>The fast riding of the day had wearied Smith exceedingly.
An hour's rest in camp however, had restored him, to such
an extent, {93} that our anxiety as to his ability to ride to
Bent's was much diminished. His noble mule proved too
nimble and easy to gratify the malice of the vagabond leader.
The night brought us its usual tribute&mdash;a storm. It was
as severe as any we had experienced. If we may distinguish
between the severities of these awful tumults of nature,
the thunder was heavier, deeper. The wind also was very
severe. It came in long gusts, loaded with large drops of
rain, which struck through the canvas of our tent, as if it
had been gauze.</p>

<p>The last day of June gave us a lovely morning. The
grass looked green upon the flinty plains. Nor did the
apparent fact that they were doomed to the constant recurrence
of long draughts take from them some of the interest
which gathers around the hills and dales within the lines of
the States. There is indeed a wide difference in the outline
of the surface and the productions of these regions. In
the plains are none of the evergreen ridges, the cold clear
springs, and snug flowering valleys of New England; none<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
of the pulse of busy men that beats from the Atlantic through
the great body of human industry to the western border
of the {94} republic; none of the sweet villages and homes
of the old Saxon race; but there are the vast savannahs,
resembling molten seas of emerald sparkling with flowers,
arrested while stormy and heaving, and fixed in eternal
repose. Nor are lowing herds to be found there, and bleating
flocks, which dependance on man has rendered subservient
to his will; but there are thousands of fleet and silent
antelope, myriads of the bellowing buffalo, the perpetual
patrimony of the wild, uncultivated red man. And however
other races may prefer the haunts of their childhood,
the well-fenced domain and the stall-pampered beast&mdash;still,
even they cannot fail to perceive the same fitness of
things in the beautiful adaptation of these conditions of
nature to the wants and pleasures of her uncultivated lords.</p>

<p>We made fifteen miles on the 1st of July. The bluffs
along the river began now to be striped with strata of lime
and sand-stone. No trees that could claim the denomination
of timber appeared in sight. Willows of various kinds,
a cotton-wood tree, at intervals of miles, were all; and so
utterly sterile was the whole country that, as night approached,
we were obliged carefully to search along {95}
the river's bends for a plat of grass of sufficient size to feed
our animals. Our encampment was twelve miles above
Choteau's Island.<a name="FNanchor_49" id="FNanchor_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a> Here was repeated, for the twentieth
time, the quarrel about the relative and moral merits of the
company. This was always a question of deep interest
with the mutineers; and many were the amusing arguments
adduced and insisted upon as incontestible, to prove themselves
great men, pure men, and saints. But as there was
much difference of opinion, I shall not be expected to remember
all the important judgments rendered in the premises.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span></p>

<p>If, however, my recollection serves me, it was adjudged,
that our distinguished leader was the only man among
us that ever saw the plains or mountains, the only one
of us that ever drove an ox-waggon up the Platte, stole a
horse and rifle from his employers, opened and plundered
a "cache" of goods, and ran back to the States with well-founded
pretensions to an "honest character."</p>

<p>Matters of this kind being thus satisfactorily settled, we
gave ourselves to the musquitoes for the night. These
companions of our sleeping hours were much attached to
us&mdash;an amiable quality which {96} "runs in the blood;"
and not unlike the birthright virtues of another race in its
effect upon our happiness.</p>

<p>It can scarcely be imparting information to my readers to
say that we passed a sleepless night. But it is due to the
guards outside the tent, to remark, that each and every one
of them manifested the most praiseworthy vigilance, and
industry, during the entire night. So keen a sense of duty
did musquito beaks impart.</p>

<p>The next day we travelled twelve miles, and fell in with
a band of buffalo. There being a quantity of wood near at
hand wherewithal to cure meat, we determined to dry, in
this place, what might be needed, till we should fall in with
buffalo again beyond the hunting-grounds of the Messrs.
Bents. Some of the men, for this purpose, filed off to the
game, while the remainder formed the encampment. The
chase was spirited and long. They succeeded, however, in
bringing down two noble bullocks: and led their horses in,
loaded with the choicest meat.</p>

<p>In preparing and jerking our meat, our man of the stolen
rifle here assumed extraordinary powers in the management
of {97} affairs. Like other braves, arm in hand, he
recounted the exploits of his past life, consisting of the entertainment
of serious <i>intentions</i> to have killed some of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
men who had left, had they remained with us; and also, of
<i>how dangerous his wrath would have been</i> in the settlements
and elsewhere, had any indignity been offered to his honourable
person, or his plantation; of which latter he held the
fee simple title of a "squatter." On this point, "let any
man, or Government even," said he, "attempt to deprive
me of my inborn rights, and my rifle shall be the judge
between us. Government and laws! what are they but
impositions upon the freeman." With this ebullition of
wrath at the possibility that the institutions of society might
demand of him a rifle, or the Government a price of a portion
of the public lands in his possession, he appeared satisfied
that he had convinced us of his moral acumen, and sat
himself down, with his well-fed and corpulent coadjutor,
to slice the meat for drying. While thus engaged, he again
raised the voice of wisdom. "These democratic parties
for the plains, what are they? what is equality any where?
A fudge. One must {98} rule; the rest obey, and no grumbling,
by G&mdash;&mdash;!"</p>

<p>The mutineers were vastly edified by these timely instructions;
and the man of parts ceasing to speak, directed his
attention to drying the meat. He, however, soon broke
forth again, found fault with every arrangement which had
been made, and with his own mighty arm wrought the
changes he desired.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, he was rousing the fire, already burning
fiercely, to more and more activity, till the dropping grease
blazed, and our scaffold of meat was wrapped in flames.</p>

<p>"Take that meat off," roared he. No one obeyed, and
he stood still. "Take that meat off," he cried again, with
the emphasis and mien of an Emperor; not deigning himself
to soil his rags, by obeying his own command. No one
obeyed. The meat burned rapidly. His ire waxed high;
yet, no one was so much frightened as to heed his command.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
At length his sublime forbearance had an end. The great
man seized the blazing meat, dashed it upon the ground,
raised the temperature of his fingers to the blistering
point, and rested from his labours.</p>

<p>{99} Three days more fatiguing travel along the bank of
the Arkansas brought us to the trading-post of the Messrs.
Bents. It was about two o'clock in the afternoon of the
5th of July, when we came in sight of its noble battlements,
and struck our caravan into a lively pace down the swell
of the neighbouring plain. The stray mules that we had
in charge belonging to the Bents, scented their old grazing
ground, and galloped cheerfully onward. And our hearts,
relieved from the anxieties which had made our camp for
weeks past a travelling Babel, leaped for joy as the gates
of the fort were thrown open; and "welcome to Fort William"&mdash;the
hearty welcome of fellow-countrymen in the
wild wilderness, greeted us. Peace again&mdash;roofs again&mdash;safety
again from the winged arrows of the savage; relief
again from the depraved suggestions of inhumanity; bread,
ah! bread again: and a prospect of a delightful tramp over
the snowy heights between me and Oregon, with a few men
of true and generous spirit, were some of the many sources
of pleasure which struggled with my slumbers on the first
night's tarry among the hospitalities of "Fort William."<a name="FNanchor_50" id="FNanchor_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a></p>

<p>{100} My company was to disband here; the property held in
common to be divided; and each individual to be left to his own
resources. And while these and other things are being done,
the reader will allow me to introduce him to the Great Prairie
Wilderness, and the beings and matters therein contained.</p>

and prominent at the bar, had seven sons. The third, John (1803-45),
remained in St. Louis, was admitted to the bar, and held the office of district
attorney. The others went out upon the frontier. In 1826 William W., Charles,
Robert, and George formed a partnership with Ceran St. Vrain and built a picket
fort high up on the Arkansas. The following year they removed somewhat farther
east, and built an adobe. William W. Bent was the chief founder of the enterprise.
A daring Indian fighter, tradition describes his defeat of two hundred
savages after a three days' battle. He married a Cheyenne woman, and made
his home at Bent's Fort. In 1847-48 he acted as guide for the American army
against New Mexico, whence his title of colonel. For one year (1859) he served
as Indian agent, and died at his home in Colorado, May 19, 1869. Robert and
George both died young, about the year 1841. They were buried near the fort,
their remains afterwards being removed to St. Louis. For Charles Bent, who

or Sioux&mdash;Chippeways, and their traditions.</p></div>


<p>The tract of country to which I have thought it fitting to
apply the name of the "Great Prairie Wilderness," embraces
the territory lying between the States of Louisiana,
Arkansas, and Missouri, and the Upper Mississippi on the
east, and the Black Hills, and the eastern range of the
Rocky and the Cordilleras mountains on the west. One
thousand miles of longitude, and two thousand miles of
latitude, 2,000,000 square miles, equal to 1,280,000,000
acres of an almost unbroken plain! The sublime Prairie
Wilderness!</p>

<p>The portion of this vast region, two {102} hundred miles
in width, along the coast of Texas and the frontier of the
States of Louisiana, Arkansas, and Missouri, and that lying
within the same distance of the Upper Mississippi in the
Iowa Territory, possess a rich, deep, alluvial soil, capable
of producing the most abundant crops of grains, vegetables,
&amp;c., that grow in such latitudes.</p>

<p>Another portion lying west of the irregular western line
of that just described, five hundred miles in width, extending
from the mouth of St. Peter's River to the Rio del Norte,
is an almost unbroken plain, destitute of trees, except here
and there one scattered at intervals for many miles along
the banks of the streams. The soil, except the intervals of
some of the rivers, is composed of coarse sand and clay, so
thin and hard that it is difficult for travellers to penetrate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
it with the stakes they carry with them wherewithal to fasten
their animals or spread their tents. Nevertheless it is
covered thickly with an extremely nutritious grass peculiar
to this region of country, the blades of which are wiry and
about two inches in height.</p>

<p>The remainder of this Great Wilderness, lying three hundred
miles in width along {103} the eastern radices of the
Black Hills and that part of the Rocky Mountains between
the Platte and the Cordilleras-range east of the Rio del
Norte, is the arid waste usually called the "Great American
Desert."<a name="FNanchor_51" id="FNanchor_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a> Its soil is composed of dark gravel mixed with
the sand. Some small portions of it, on the banks of the
streams, are covered with tall prairie and bunch grass; others,
with wild wormwood; but even these kinds of vegetation
decrease and finally disappear as you approach the mountains.
It is a scene of desolation scarcely equalled on the
continent, when viewed in the dearth of midsummer from
the base of the hills. Above, rise in sublime confusion,
mass upon mass, shattered cliffs through which is struggling
the dark foliage of stinted shrub-cedars; while below
you spreads far and wide the burnt and arid desert, whose
solemn silence is seldom broken by the tread of any other
animal than the wolf or the starved and thirsty horse which
bears the traveller across its wastes.</p>

<p>The principal streams that intersect the Great Prairie
wilderness are the Colorado, the Brazos, Trinity, Red,
Arkansas, Great Platte and the Missouri. The latter is
in many respects a noble stream; not so {104} much so
indeed for the intercourse it opens between the States and
the plains, as the theatre of agriculture and the other pursuits
of a densely populated and distant interior; for these
plains are too barren for general cultivation. As a channel
for the transportation of heavy artillery, military stores,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
troops, &amp;c. to posts that must ultimately be established
along our northern frontier, it will be of the highest use.</p>

<p>In the months of April, May, and June it is navigable
for steamboats to the Great Falls; but the scarcity of water
during the remainder of the year, as well as the scarcity of
wood and coal along its banks, its steadily rapid current,
its tortuous course, its falling banks, timber imbedded in
the mud of its channel, and its constantly shifting sand
bars, will ever prevent its waters from being extensively
navigated, how great soever may be the demand for it. In
that part of it which lies above the mouth of the Little
Missouri and the tributaries flowing into it on either side,
are said to be many charming and productive valleys,
separated from each other by secondary rocky ridges sparsely
covered with evergreen trees; and high over all, far in south-west,
west and north-west, tower into {105} view, the ridges
of the Rocky Mountains, whose inexhaustible magazines of
ice and snow have, from age to age, supplied these valleys
with refreshing springs&mdash;and the Missouri&mdash;the Great
Platte&mdash;the Columbia&mdash;and Western Colorado rivers with
their tribute to the seas.</p>

<p>Lewis and Clark, on their way to Oregon in 1805, made
the Portage at the Great Falls eighteen miles. In this
distance the water descends three hundred and sixty-two
feet. The first great pitch is ninety-eight feet, the
second nineteen, the third forty-eight, and the fourth
twenty-six. Smaller rapids make up the remainder of
the descent. After passing over the Portage with their
boats and baggage, they again entrusted themselves to the
turbulent stream&mdash;entered the chasms of the Rocky Mountains
seventy-one miles above the upper rapids of the
Falls, penetrated them one hundred and eighty miles,
with the mere force of their oars against the current, to
Gallatin, Madison and Jefferson's Forks&mdash;and in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
same manner ascended Jefferson's River two hundred and
forty-eight miles to the extreme head of navigation, making
from the mouth of the Missouri, whence they started, three
thousand and ninety-six {106} miles; four hundred and
twenty-nine of which lay among the sublime crags and
cliffs of the mountains.<a name="FNanchor_52" id="FNanchor_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a></p>

<p>The Great Platte has a course by its northern fork of
about one thousand five hundred miles; and by its southern
fork somewhat more than that distance; from its entrance
into the Missouri to the junction of these forks about four
hundred miles. The north fork rises in Wind River Mountain,
north of the Great Pass through Long's range of the
Rocky Mountains, in latitude 42&deg; north.<a name="FNanchor_53" id="FNanchor_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a> The south fork
rises one hundred miles west of James Peak, and within
fifteen miles of the point where the Arkansas escapes from
the chasms of the mountains, in latitude 39&deg; north.<a name="FNanchor_54" id="FNanchor_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a> This
river is not navigable for steamboats at any season of the
year. In the spring floods, the batteaux of the American
fur traders descend it from the forts on its forks. But even
this is so hazardous that they are beginning to prefer taking
down their furs in waggons by the way of the Kansas River
to Westport, Missouri, thence by steamboat to St. Louis.
During the summer and autumn months its waters are too
shallow to float a canoe. In the winter it is bound in ice.
Useless as it is for {107} purposes of navigation, it is destined
to be of great value in another respect.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span></p>

<p>The overland travel from the States to Oregon and California
will find its great highway along its banks. So that
in years to come, when the Federal Government shall take
possession of its Territory West of the Mountains, the banks
of this stream will be studded with fortified posts for the
protection of countless caravans of American citizens emigrating
thither to establish their abode; or of those that
are willing to endure or destroy the petty tyranny of the
Californian Government, for a residence in that most beautiful,
productive country. Even now, loaded waggons can
pass without serious interruption from the mouth of the
Platte to navigable waters on the Columbia River in
Oregon, and the Bay of San Francisco, in California.<a name="FNanchor_55" id="FNanchor_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a></p>

<p>As it may interest my readers to peruse a description of
these routes given me by different individuals who had often
travelled them, I will insert it: "Land on the north side of
the mouth of the Platte; follow up that stream to the Forks,
four hundred miles; in this distance only one stream where
a raft will be needed, and that near the Missouri; all the
rest fordable. At the Forks, take the north side of {108}
the North one; fourteen days' travel to the Black Hills;
thence leaving the river's bank, strike off in a North-West
direction to the Sweetwater branch, at "Independence
Rock," (a large rock in the plain on which the old trappers
many years ago carved the word "Independence" and their
own names; oval in form;) follow up the sweet-water three
days; cross it and go to its head; eight or ten days travel
this; then cross over westward to the head waters of a small
creek running southwardly into the Platte, thence westward
to Big Sandy creek two days, (this creek is a large<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
stream coming from Wind river Mountains in the North;)
thence one day to Little Sandy creek&mdash;thence westward
over three or four creeks to Green River, (Indian name
Sheetskadee,) strike it at the mouth of Horse creek&mdash;follow
it down three days to Pilot Bute; thence strike westward
one day to Ham's Fork of Green River&mdash;two days
up Ham's Fork&mdash;thence West one day to Muddy Branch
of Great Bear River&mdash;down it one day to Great Bear
River&mdash;down this four days to Soda Springs; turn to the
right up a valley a quarter of a mile below the Soda Springs;
follow it up a north west direction two days to its head;
there take the left hand valley leading over the dividing
{109} ridge; one day over to the waters of Snake River at
Fort Hall;<a name="FNanchor_56" id="FNanchor_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a> thence down Snake River twenty days to the
junction of the Lewis and Clark Rivers&mdash;or twenty days
travel westwardly by the Mary's River&mdash;thence through
a natural and easy passage in the California Mountains to
the navigable waters of the San Joaquin&mdash;a noble stream
emptying into the Bay of San Francisco."<a name="FNanchor_57" id="FNanchor_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span></p>

<p>The Platte therefore when considered in relation to our
intercourse with the habitable countries on the Western
Ocean assumes an unequal importance among the streams
of the Great Prairie Wilderness! But for it, it would be
impossible for man or beast to travel those arid plains,
destitute alike, of wood, water and grass, save what of each
is found along its course. Upon the head waters of its
North Fork, too, is the only way or opening in the Rocky
mountains at all practicable for a carriage road through
them. That traversed by Lewis and Clark, is covered
with perpetual snow; that near the debouchure of the
South Fork of the river is over high and nearly impassable
precipices; that travelled by myself farther south, is, and
ever will be impassable for wheel carriages. But the Great
Gap, nearly {110} on a right line between the mouth of
Missouri and Fort Hall on Clark's River&mdash;the point
where the trails to California and Oregon diverge&mdash;seems
designed by nature as the great gateway between the
nations on the Atlantic and Pacific seas.<a name="FNanchor_58" id="FNanchor_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a></p>

<p>The Red River has a course of about one thousand five
hundred miles. It derives its name from a reddish colour
of its water, produced by a rich red earth or marl in its
banks, far up in the Prairie Wilderness. So abundantly
is this mingled with its waters during the spring freshets,
that as the floods retire, they leave upon the lands they have
overflowed a deposit of half an inch in thickness. Three
hundred miles from its mouth commences what is called
"The Raft," a covering formed by drift-wood, which conceals
the whole river for an extent of about forty miles.
And so deeply is this immense bridge covered with the sediment
of the stream, that all kinds of vegetable common in
its neighbourhood, even trees of a considerable size, are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
growing upon it. The annual inundations are said to be
cutting a new channel near the hill. Steamboats ascend
the river to the Raft, and might go fifty leagues above, if
that obstruction were removed.<a name="FNanchor_59" id="FNanchor_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a> Above this latter point
{111} the river is said to be embarrassed by many rapids,
shallows, falls, and sand-bars. Indeed, for seven hundred
miles its broad bed is represented to be an extensive and
perfect sand-bar; or rather a series of sand-bars; among
which during the summer months, the water stands in ponds.
As you approach the mountains, however, it becomes contracted
within narrow limits over a gravelly bottom, and a
swift, clear, and abundant stream. The waters of the Red
River are so brackish when low, as to be unfit for common
use.</p>

<p>The Trinity River, the Brazos, and the Rio Colorado,
have each a course of about twelve hundred miles, rising in
the plains and mountains on the north and north-west side
of Texas, and running south south-east into the Gulf of
Mexico.</p>

<p>The Rio Bravo del Norte<a name="FNanchor_60" id="FNanchor_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a> bounds the Great Prairie
Wilderness on the south and south-west. It is one thousand
six hundred and fifty miles long. The extent of its navigation
is little known. Lieutenant Pike remarks in regard to
it, that "for the extent of four or five hundred miles before
you arrive near the mountains, the bed of the river is extensive
and a perfect sand-bar, which at a certain season is
dry, at least the waters stand {112} in ponds, not affording
sufficient to procure a running course. When you come
nearer the mountains, you find the river contracted, a
gravelly bottom and a deep navigable stream. From these
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>circumstances it is evident that the sandy soil imbibes all
the waters which the sources project from the mountains,
and render the river in dry seasons <i>less navigable five hundred
miles</i>, than two hundred from its source." Perhaps
we should understand the Lieutenant to mean that five
hundred miles of sand bar and two hundred miles immediately
below its source being taken from its whole course,
the remainder, nine hundred and fifty miles, would be the
length of its navigable waters.<a name="FNanchor_61" id="FNanchor_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a></p>

<p>The Arkansas, after the Missouri, is the most considerable
river of the country under consideration. It takes its rise
in that cluster of secondary mountains which lie at the
eastern base of the Anahuac Ridge, in latitude 41&deg; north&mdash;eighty
or ninety miles north-west of James Peak. It runs
about two hundred miles&mdash;first in a southerly and then in
a south-easterly direction among these mountains; at one
time along the most charming valleys and at another through
the most awful chasms&mdash;till it rushes from them with a
foaming {113} current in latitude 39&deg; north. From the
place of its debouchure to its entrance into the Mississippi
is a distance of 1981 miles; its total length 2173 miles.
About fifty miles below a tributary of this stream, called
the Grand Saline,<a name="FNanchor_62" id="FNanchor_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a> a series of sand-bars commence and run
down the river several hundred miles. Among them, during
the dry season, the water stands in isolated pools, with
no apparent current. But such is the quantity of water
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>sent down from the mountains by this noble stream at the
time of the annual freshets, that there is sufficient depth,
even upon these bars, to float large and heavy boats; and
having once passed these obstructions, they can be taken
up to the place where the river escapes from the crags of
the mountains. Boats intended to ascend the river, should
start from the mouth about the 1st of February. The
Arkansas will be useful in conveying munitions of war to
our southern frontier. In the dry season, the waters of this
river are strongly impregnated with salt and nitre.</p>

<p>There are about 135,000 Indians inhabiting the Great
Prairie Wilderness,<a name="FNanchor_63" id="FNanchor_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a> of whose social and civil condition,
manners and customs, &amp;c. I will give a brief account. {114}
It would seem natural to commence with those tribes which
reside in what is called "The Indian Territory;" a tract
of country bounded south by the Red River, east by the
States of Arkansas and Missouri&mdash;on the north-east and
north by the Missouri and Punch Rivers,<a name="FNanchor_64" id="FNanchor_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a> and west by
the western limit of habitable country on this side of the
Rocky Mountains. This the National Government has
purchased of the indigenous tribes at specific prices; and
under treaty stipulations to pay them certain annuities in
cash, and certain others in facilities for learning the useful
arts, and for acquiring that knowledge of all kinds of
truth which will, as is supposed, in the end excite the wants,
create the industry, and confer upon them the happiness
of the civilized state.</p>

<p>These benevolent intentions of Government, however,
have a still wider reach. Soon after the English power
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>had been extinguished here, the enlightened men who had
raised over its ruins the temples of equal justice, began to
make efforts to restore to the Indians within the colonies the
few remaining rights that British injustice had left within
their power to return; and so to exchange property with
them, as to {115} secure to the several States the right of
sovereignty within their several limits, and to the Indians,
the functions of a sovereign power, restricted in this, that
the tribes should not sell their lands to other person or body
corporate, or civil authority, beside the Government of the
United States; and in some other respects restricted, so as
to preserve peace among the tribes, prevent tyranny, and lead
them to the greatest happiness they are capable of enjoying.<a name="FNanchor_65" id="FNanchor_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a></p>

<p>Various and numerous were the efforts made to raise and
ameliorate their condition in their old haunts within the
precincts of the States. But a total or partial failure followed
them all. In a few cases, indeed, there seemed a
certain prospect of final success, if the authorities of the
States in which they resided had permitted them to remain
where they were. But as all experience tended to prove that
their proximity to the whites induced among them more vice
than virtue; and as the General Government, before any
attempts had been made to elevate them, had become
bound to remove them from {116} many of the States in
which they resided, both the welfare of the Indians, and the
duty of the Government, urged their colonization in a portion
of the western domain, where, freed from all questions
of conflicting sovereignties, and under the protection of the
Union, and their own municipal regulations, they might
find a refuge from those influences which threatened the
annihilation of their race.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span></p>
<p>The "Indian Territory" has been selected for this purpose.
And assuredly if an inexhaustible soil, producing all
the necessaries of life in greater abundance, and with a
third less labour than they are produced in the Atlantic
States, with excellent water, fine groves of timber growing
by the streams, rocky cliffs rising at convenient distances
for use among the deep alluvial plains, mines of iron and
lead ore and coal, lakes and springs and streams of salt
water, and innumerable quantities of buffalo ranging
through their lands, are sufficient indications that this country
is a suitable dwelling-place for a race of men which is
passing from the savage to the civilized condition, the Indian
Territory has been well chosen as the home of these
unfortunate people. Thither the Government, for the last
thirty years, has been endeavouring {117} to induce those
within the jurisdiction of the States to emigrate.<a name="FNanchor_66" id="FNanchor_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a></p>

<p>The Government purchase the land which the emigrating
tribes leave&mdash;giving them others within the Territory;
transport them to their new abode; erect a portion of their
dwellings; plough and fence a portion of their fields;
furnish them teachers of agriculture, and implements of
husbandry, horses, cattle, &amp;c.; erect schoolhouses, and
support teachers in them the year round; make provision
for the subsistence of those who, by reason of their recent
emigration, are unable to support themselves; and do
every other act of benevolence necessary to put within
their ability to enjoy, not only all the physical comforts
that they left behind them, but also every requisite, facility,
and encouragement to become a reasoning, cultivated, and
happy people.</p>

<p>Nor does this spirit of liberality stop here. The great
doctrine that Government is formed to confer upon its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
subjects a greater degree of happiness than they could
enjoy in the natural state, has suggested that the system of
hereditary chieftaincies, and its dependant evils among the
tribes, should yield, as circumstances may permit, to the
ordination of nature, the supremacy {118} of intellect and
virtue. Accordingly, it is contemplated to use the most
efficient means to abolish them, making the rulers elective,
establishing a form of government in each tribe, similar
in department and duties to our State Governments, and
uniting the tribes under a General Government, similar in
powers and functions to that at Washington.<a name="FNanchor_67" id="FNanchor_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a></p>

<p>It is encouraging to know that some of the tribes have
adopted this system; and that the Government of the
Union has been so far encouraged to hope for its adoption
by all those in the Indian Territory, that in 1837 orders
were issued from the Department of Indian affairs, to the
Superintendent of Surveys, to select and report a suitable
place for the Central Government. A selection was accordingly
made of a charming and valuable tract of land
on the Osage river, about seven miles square; which, on
account of its equal distance from the northern and southern
line of the Territory, and the beauty and excellence
of the surrounding country, appears in every way adapted
to its contemplated use. It is a little more than sixteen
miles from the western line of Missouri. Any member of
those tribes which come into the confederation, may own
property in the district, and no other.<a name="FNanchor_68" id="FNanchor_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span></p>

<p>{119} The indigenous, or native tribes of the Indian
Territory, are&mdash;the Osages, about 5,510; the Kauzaus or
Caws, 1,720; the Omahas, 1,400; the Otoe and Missouri,
1,600; the Pawnee, 10,000; Puncah, 800; Quapaw, 600&mdash;making
21,660. The tribes that have emigrated thither
from the States, are&mdash;the Choctaw, 15,600 (this estimate
includes 200 white men, married to Choctaw women, and
600 negro slaves); the Chickasaws, 5,500; the Cherokees,
22,000 (this estimate includes 1,200 negro slaves owned by
them); the Cherokees (including 900 slaves), 22,000; the
Creeks (including 393 negro slaves) 22,500; the Senecas
and Shawnees, 461; the Seminoles, 1,600; the Pottawatamies,
1,650; the Weas, 206; the Piankashas, 157; the
Peorias and Kaskaskias, 142; the Ottawas, 240; the Shawnees,
823; the Delawares, 921; the Kickapoos, 400; the
Sauks, 600; the Iowas, 1,000. It is to be understood that
the numbers assigned to these tribes represent only those
portions of them which have actually removed to the Territory.
Large numbers of several tribes are still within the
borders of the States. It appears from the above tables,
then, that 72,200 have had lands assigned them; and,
abating the relative {120} effects of births and deaths
among them, in increasing or diminishing their numbers,
are actually residing in the Territory. These, added to
21,000 of the indigenous tribes, amount to 94,860 under
the fostering care of the Federal Government, in a fertile
and delightful country, six hundred miles in length from
north to south, and east and west from the frontier of the
Republic to the deserts of the mountains.</p>

<p>The Choctaw country lies in the extreme south of the
Territory. Its boundaries are&mdash;on the south, the Red
River, which separates it from the Republic of Texas; on
the west, by that line running from the Red River to the
Arkansas River, which separates the Indian American<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
Territory from that of Mexico;<a name="FNanchor_69" id="FNanchor_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a> on the north, by the Arkansas
and the Canadian Rivers; and on the east, by the State
of Arkansas. This tract is capable of producing the most
abundant crops, the small grains, Indian corn, flax, hemp,
tobacco, cotton, &amp;c. The western portion of it is poorly
supplied with timber; but all the distance from the Arkansas'
frontier westward, two hundred miles, and extending
one hundred and sixty miles from its northern to its southern
boundary, the country is capable of supporting {121} a
population as dense as that of England. 19,200,000 acres
of soil suitable for immediate settlement, and a third as
much more to the westward that would produce the black
locust in ten years after planting, of sufficient size for
fencing the very considerable part of it which is rich
enough for agricultural purposes, will, doubtless, sustain
any increased population of this tribe that can reasonably
be looked for during the next five hundred years.</p>

<p>They have suffered much from sickness incident to settlers
in a new country. But there appear to be no natural
causes existing, which, in the known order of things, will
render their location permanently unhealthy. On the
other hand, since they have become somewhat inured to
the change of climate, they are quite as healthy as the whites
near them; and are improving in civilization and comfort;
have many large farms; much live stock, such as horses,
mules, cattle, sheep, and swine; three flouring-mills, two
cotton-gins, eighty-eight looms, and two hundred and
twenty spinning-wheels; carts, waggons, and other farming
utensils. Three or four thousand Choctaws have not yet
settled on the lands assigned to them. A part of these are
in {122} Texas, between the rivers Brazos and Trinity, 300
in number, who located themselves there in the time of the
general emigration; and others in divers places in Texas,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>
who emigrated thither at various times twenty, thirty, and
forty years ago. Still another band continues to reside east
of the Mississippi.</p>

<p>The Choctaw Nation, as the tribe denominates itself, has
adopted a written constitution of Government, similar to
the Constitution of the United States. Their Declaration
of Rights secures to all ranks and sects equal rights, liberty
of conscience, and trial by jury, &amp;c. It may be altered or
amended by a National Council. They have divided their
country into four judicial districts. Three of them annually
elect nine, and the other thirteen, members of the National
Assembly. They meet on the first Monday in October
annually; organize by the election of a Speaker, the necessary
clerks, a light-horseman (sergeant-at-arms), and doorkeeper;
adopt by-laws, or rules for their governance, while
in session; and make other regulations requisite for the
systematic transaction of business. The journals are kept
in the English language; but in the progress of business are
read off {123} in Choctaw. The preliminary of a law is,
"Be it enacted by the General Council of the Choctaw
Nation."</p>

<p>By the Constitution, the Government is composed of
four departments, viz.: Legislative, Executive, Judicial
and Military. Three judges are elected in each district by
popular vote, who hold inferior and superior courts within
their respective districts. Ten light-horse men in each district
perform the duties of sheriffs. An act has been passed
for the organization of the militia. Within each judicial
district an officer is elected, denominated a chief, who holds
his office for the term of four years. These chiefs have
honorary seats in the National Council. Their signatures
are necessary to the passage of a law. If they veto an
act, it may become a law by the concurrence of two-thirds
of the Council. Thus have the influences of our institu<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>tions
begun to tame and change the savages of the western
wilderness.<a name="FNanchor_70" id="FNanchor_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a></p>

<p>At the time when the lights of religion and science had
scarcely begun to dawn upon them&mdash;when they had scarcely
discovered the clouds of ignorance that had walled every
avenue to rational life&mdash;even while the dust of antiquated
barbarism was {124} still hanging upon their garments&mdash;and
the night of ages, of sloth, and sin held them in its cold
embraces&mdash;the fires on the towers of this great temple of
civil freedom arrested their slumbering faculties, and they
read on all the holy battlements, written with beams of
living light, "All men are, and of right ought to be, free and
equal." This teaching leads them. It was a pillar of fire
moving over the silent grave of the past&mdash;enlightening the
vista of coming years&mdash;and, by its winning brightness,
inviting them to rear in the Great Prairie wilderness, a
sanctuary of republican liberty&mdash;of equal laws&mdash;in which
to deposit the ark of their own future well-being.</p>

<p>The Chickasaws have become merged in the Choctaws.
When they sold to the Government their lands east of the
Mississippi, they agreed to furnish themselves with a home.
This they have done in the western part of the Choctaw<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
country for the sum of &pound;106,000. It is called the
Chickasaw district; and constitutes an integral part of
the Choctaw body politic in every respect, except that the
Chickasaws, like the Choctaws, received and invest for
their own sole use, the annuities and other moneys proceeding
from the sale of their lands east of the Mississippi.<a name="FNanchor_71" id="FNanchor_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a></p>

<p>{125} The treaty of 1830 provides for keeping forty
Choctaw youths at school, under the direction of the President
of the United States, for the term of twenty years.
Also, the sum of &pound;500 is to be applied to the support of
three teachers of schools among them for the same length
of time. There is, also, an unexpended balance of former
annuities, amounting to about &pound;5,000, which is to be applied
to the support of schools, at twelve different places. Schoolhouses
have been erected for this purpose, and paid for,
out of this fund. Also, by the treaty of 1825, they are
entitled to an annuity of &pound;1,200, for the support of schools
within the Choctaw district.</p>

<p>The treaty of the 24th of May, 1834, provides that &pound;600
annually, for fifteen years, shall be applied, under the direction
of the Secretary of War, to the education of the Chickasaws.
These people have become very wealthy, by the
cession of their lands east of the Mississippi to the United
States. They have a large fund applicable to various
objects of civilization; &pound;2,000 of which is, for the present,
applied to purposes of education.<a name="FNanchor_72" id="FNanchor_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a></p>

<p>The country assigned to the Cherokees is bounded as
follows: beginning on the {126} north bank of Arkansas
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>River, where the western line of the State of Arkansas
crosses the river; thence north 7&deg; 35&acute; west, along the line of
the State of Arkansas, seventy-seven miles to the south-west
corner of the State of Missouri; thence north along
the line of Missouri, eight miles to Seneca River; thence
west along the southern boundary of the Senecas to
Neosho River; thence up said river to the Osage lands;
thence west with the South boundary of the Osage lands,
two hundred and eighty-eight and a half miles; thence
south to the Creek lands, and east along the north line
of the creeks, to a point about forty-three miles west of
the State of Arkansas, and twenty-five miles north of
Arkansas River, thence south to Verdigris River, thence
down Verdigris to Arkansas River; thence down Arkansas
River to the mouth of Neosho River; thence South 53&deg;
west one mile; thence south 18&deg; 19&acute; west thirty-three miles;
thence south four miles, to the junction of the North Fork
and Canadian Rivers; thence down the latter to the
Arkansas; and thence down the Arkansas, to the place
of beginning.<a name="FNanchor_73" id="FNanchor_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a></p>

<p>They also own a tract, described, by beginning at the
south-east corner of the Osage lands, and running north with
the Osage line, fifty miles; thence east twenty-five {127} miles
to the west line of Missouri; thence west twenty-five miles,
to the place of beginning.</p>

<p>They own numerous Salt Springs, three of which are
worked by Cherokees. The amount of Salt manufactured
is probably about 100 bushels per day. They also own two
Lead Mines. Their Salt Works and Lead Mines are in the
Eastern portion of their country. All the settlements yet
formed are there also. It embraces about 2,500,000 acres.
They own about 20,000 head of cattle, 3,000 horses, 15,000<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
hogs, 600 sheep, 110 waggons, often several ploughs to one
farm, several hundred spinning wheels, and one hundred
looms. Their fields are enclosed with rail fences. They
have erected for themselves good log dwellings, with stone
chimneys and plank floors. Their houses are furnished
with plain tables, chairs, and bedsteads, and with table and
kitchen furniture, nearly or quite equal to the dwellings of
white people in new countries.&mdash;They have seven native merchants,
and one regular physician, beside several "quacks."
Houses of entertainment, with neat and comfortable accommodation,
are found among them.</p>

<p>Their settlements are divided into four districts, each of
which elects for the term {128} of two years, two members
of the National Council&mdash;the title of which is, "The
General Council of the Cherokee Nation." By law, it
meets annually on the first Monday in October. They
have three chiefs, which till lately have been chosen by the
General Council. Hereafter, they are to be elected by
the people. The approval of the chiefs is necessary to the
passage of a law; but an act upon which they have fixed
their veto, may become a law by a vote of two thirds of
the Council. The Council consists of two branches. The
lower is denominated the <i>Committee</i>, and the upper, the
<i>Council</i>. The concurrence of both is necessary to the
passage of a law. The chiefs may call a Council at pleasure.
In this, and in several other respects, they retain in
some degree the authority common to hereditary chiefs.
Two Judges belong to each district, who hold courts when
necessary. Two officers, denominated Light-horsemen,
in each district perform the duties of Sheriffs. A company
of six or seven Light-horsemen, the leader of whom is styled
captain, constitute a National Corps of Regulators, to prevent
infractions of the law, and to bring offenders to justice.<a name="FNanchor_74" id="FNanchor_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span></p>

<p>It is stipulated in the treaty of the 6th {129} of May, 1823,
that the United States will pay &pound;400 annually to the Cherokees
for ten years, to be expended under the direction of the
President of the United States, in the education of their
children, <i>in their own country</i>, in letters and mechanic arts.
Also &pound;200 toward the purchase of a printing-press and types.
By the treaty of December 29, 1835, the sum of &pound;30,000 is
provided for the support of common schools, and such a
literary institution of a higher order as may be established
in the Indian country. The above sum is to be added to an
education fund of &pound;10,000 that previously existed, making
the sum of &pound;40,000 which is to remain a permanent school
fund, only the interest of which is to be consumed. The
application of this money is to be directed by the Cherokee
Nation, under the supervision of the President of the United
States. The interest of it will be sufficient constantly to
keep in a boarding-school two hundred children; or eight
hundred, if boarded by their parents.</p>

<p>The country of the Creeks joins Canadian river, and the
lands of the Choctaws on the south, and the Cherokee lands
on the east and north. Their eastern limit is about sixty-two
miles from north to south; {130} their western limit the
Mexican boundary.<a name="FNanchor_75" id="FNanchor_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a></p>

<p>Their country is fertile, and exhibits a healthy appearance;
but of the latter Creek emigrants who reached Arkansas in
the winter and spring of 1837, about two hundred died on
the road; and before the 1st of October succeeding the
arrival, about three thousand five hundred more fell victims
to bilious fevers. In the same year three hundred of
the earlier emigrants died. They own salt springs, cultivate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>
corn, vegetables, &amp;c., spin, weave and sew, and follow
other pursuits of civilised people. Many of them have
large stocks of cattle. Before the crops of 1837 had been
gathered, they had sold corn to the amount of upwards of
&pound;7,800; and vast quantities still remained unsold. Even
the emigrants who arrived in their country during the winter
and spring, previous to the cropping season of 1837, broke
the turf, fenced their fields, raised their crops for the first
time on the soil, and sold their surplus of corn for &pound;2,000.
They have two native merchants.</p>

<p>The civil government of this tribe is less perfect than
that of the Cherokees. There are two bands; the one
under McIntosh, the other under Little Doctor.<a name="FNanchor_76" id="FNanchor_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a> That led
{131} by the former, brought with them from their old home
written laws which they enforce as the laws of their band.
That under the latter, made written laws after their arrival.
Each party holds a general council. The members of each
are hereditary chiefs, and a class of men called councillors.
Each of these great bands is divided into lesser ones; which
severally may hold courts, try civil and criminal causes,
sentence, and execute, &amp;c. Laws, however, are made
by the general councils only; and it is becoming customary
to entertain trials of cases before these bodies, and to detail
some of their members for executioners. The legislative,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>judicial, and executive departments of their government
are thus becoming strangely united in one.</p>

<p>The treaty of the 6th of March, 1832, stipulates that an
annuity of &pound;600 shall be expended by the United States,
under the direction of the President, for the term of twenty
years, in the education of their children. Another &pound;200
by the treaty of the 14th of February, 1833, is to be annually
expended during the pleasure of Congress for the same
object, under the direction of the President.</p>

<p>In location and government the Seminoles {132} are
merged in the Creeks.<a name="FNanchor_77" id="FNanchor_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a> In the spring of 1836, about four
hundred of them emigrated from the east, and settled on
the north fork of Canadian river. In October, 1837, they
were reduced by sickness nearly one-half. During these
awful times of mortality among them, some of the dead
were deposited in the hollows of the standing and fallen
trees, and others, for want of these, were placed in a temporary
inclosure of boards, on the open plains. Guns and
other articles of property were often buried with the dead,
according to ancient custom; and so great is said to have
been the terror of the time, that, having abandoned themselves
awhile to their wailings around the burial-places of
their friends, they fled to the western deserts till the
pestilence subsided. Of the two thousand and twenty-three
emigrants who had reached their new homes prior to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>October, 1832, not more than one thousand six hundred
remained alive.</p>

<p>The Senecas consist of three bands, namely: Senecas
two hundred, Senecas and Shawanoes two hundred and
eleven, Mohawks fifty; in all four hundred and sixty-one.
The lands of the Senecas proper adjoin those of the Cherokees
on the south, {133} and abutting on the Missouri border,
the distance of thirteen miles, extend north to Neosho
river. The lands of the mixed band of Senecas and Shawanoes,
extend north between the State of Missouri and
Neosho river, so far as to include sixty-thousand acres.<a name="FNanchor_78" id="FNanchor_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a></p>

<p>These people, also, are in some measure civilized. Most
of them speak English. They have fields inclosed with
rail fences, and raise corn and vegetables sufficient for their
own use. They own about eight-hundred horses, twelve
hundred cattle, thirteen yoke of oxen, two hundred hogs,
five waggons, and sixty-seven ploughs; dwell in neat, hewn log
cabins erected by themselves, and furnished with bedsteads,
chairs, tables, &amp;c., of their own manufacture; and own one
grist and saw-mill, erected at the expense of the United States.</p>

<p>The country of the Osages lies north of the western portion
of the Cherokee lands, commencing twenty-five miles
west of the State of Missouri, and thence, in a width of fifty
miles, extends westward as far as the country can be inhabited.
In 1817, they numbered ten thousand five hundred.
Wars with the Sioux, and other causes, have left only five
thousand five hundred. {134} About half the tribe reside
on the eastern portion of their lands; the residue in the
Cherokee country, in two villages on Verdigris river.<a name="FNanchor_79" id="FNanchor_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span></p>

<p>This tribe has made scarcely any improvement. Their
fields are small and badly fenced. Their huts are constructed
of poles inserted in the ground, bent together at
the top, and covered with bark, mats, &amp;c., and some of
them with buffalo and elk skins. The fire is placed in
the centre, and the smoke escapes through an aperture at
the top. These huts are built in villages, and crowded
together without order or arrangement, and destitute of
furniture of any kind, except a platform raised about two
feet upon stakes set in the ground. This extends along
the side of the hut, and may serve for a seat, a table, or a
bedstead. The leggings, and moccasins for the feet, are
seldom worn except in cold weather, or when they are
travelling in the grass. These, with a temporary garment
fastened about the loins, and extending downwards,
and a buffalo robe or blanket thrown loosely around them,
constitute the sole wardrobe of the males and married
females. The unmarried females wear also a strip of
plain cloth eight or nine inches wide, which they throw
over {135} one shoulder, draw it over the breasts, and
fasten it under the opposite arm.</p>

<p>The Osages were, when the whites first knew them, brave,
warlike, and in the Indian sense of the term, in affluent
circumstances. They were the hardiest and fiercest enemies
of the terrible Sioux; but their independent spirit is
gone, and they have degenerated into the miserable condition
of insolent, starving thieves. The government has
been, and is making the most generous efforts to elevate
them. The treaty of 1825 provides, "that the President
of the United States shall employ such persons to aid the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>Osages in their agricultural pursuits, as to him may seem
expedient." Under this stipulation, &pound;240 annually have
been expended, for the last fifteen years. This bounty of
the government, however, has not been of any permanent
benefit to the tribe. The same treaty of 1825, required
fifty-four sections of land to be laid off and sold under the
direction of the President of the United States, and the
proceeds to be applied to the education of Osage children.
Early in the year 1838, government made an arrangement
by which they were to be paid two dollars per acre, for the
whole tract of fifty-four sections, {136} 34,560 acres. This
commutation has secured to the Osage tribe, the sum of
&pound;13,824 for education; a princely fund for five thousand
five hundred and ten individuals. Government hereditary
chieftaincies.</p>

<p>The band of Quapaws was originally connected with the
Osages. Their lands lie immediately north of the Senecas
and Shawanoes, and extend north between the state of
Missouri on the east, and Neosho River on the west, so far
as to include 96,000 acres. Their country is south-east of,
and near to the country of the Osages. Their habits are
somewhat more improved, and their circumstances more
comfortable than those of the last named tribe. They subsist
by industry at home, cultivate fields enclosed with rail
fences; and about three-fourths of them have erected for
themselves small log dwellings with chimneys. Unfortunately
for the Quapaws, they settled on the lands of the
Senecas and Shawanoes, from which they must soon remove
to their own. A small band of them, forty or fifty
in number, have settled in Texas, and about thirty others
live among the Choctaws.<a name="FNanchor_80" id="FNanchor_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a></p>

<p>The Pottawatamies, in emigrating to the west, have
unfortunately been divided into two bands. One thousand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>
or fifteen hundred {137} have located themselves on the
north-east side of the Missouri River, two hundred and
forty miles from the country designated by government as
their permanent residence. Negotiations have been made
to effect their removal to their own lands, but without success.
About fifteen hundred others have settled near the
Sauks, on the Mississippi, and manifest a desire to remain
there. The country designated for them lies on the sources
of the Osage and Neosho rivers; it commences sixteen
miles and four chains west of the State of Missouri, and in
a width of twenty-four miles, extends west two hundred
miles. By the treaty of 1833, they are allowed the sum
of &pound;14,000 for purposes of education and the encouragement
of the useful arts. Also by the same treaty, is
secured to them the sum of &pound;30,000 to be applied in the
erection of mills, farmhouses, Indian houses, and blacksmiths'
shops; to the purchase of agricultural implements
and live stock, and for the support of physicians, millers,
farmers, and blacksmiths, which the President of the United
States shall think proper to appoint to their service.<a name="FNanchor_81" id="FNanchor_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a></p>

<p>The Weas and Piankashas are bands of Miamis. Their
country lies north of the {138} Pottawatamies, adjoins the
State of Missouri on the east, the Shawanoes on the north,
and the Peorias and Kaskaskias on the west&mdash;160,000 acres.
These people own a few cattle and swine. About one-half
of their dwellings are constructed of logs, the remainder
of bark, in the old native style. Their fields are enclosed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>
with rails, and they cultivate corn and vegetables sufficient
for a comfortable subsistence. The Piankasha band is
less improved than the Weas. The former have a field of
about fifty acres, made by the government; the latter have
made their own improvements.</p>

<p>The Peorias and Kaskaskias are also bands of the Miamis.
Their land lies immediately west of the Weas; adjoins the
Shawanoes on the north, and the Ottowas on the west.
They own 96,000 acres. They are improving, live in log-houses,
have small fields generally enclosed with rail-fences,
and own considerable numbers of cattle and swine.<a name="FNanchor_82" id="FNanchor_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a></p>

<p>The lands of the Ottowas lie immediately west of the
Peorias and Kaskaskias, and south of the Shawanoes.
The first band of emigrants received 36,000 acres, and one
which arrived subsequently, 40,000 acres, adjoining the
first. They all live in good {139} log cabins, have fields
enclosed with rail-fences, raise a comfortable supply of
corn and garden vegetables, are beginning to raise wheat,
have horses, cattle and swine, a small grist-mill in operation,
and many other conveniences of life, that indicate an increasing
desire among them to seek from the soil, rather
than the chase, the means of life. About five thousand
Ottowas, residing in Michigan, are soon to be removed to
their brethren in the Territory. The country of the Ottowas
lies upon the western verge of the contemplated Indian<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
settlement, and consequently opens an unlimited range to
the westward. Their government is based on the old system
of Indian chieftaincies.<a name="FNanchor_83" id="FNanchor_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a></p>

<p>Immediately on the north of the Weas and Piankashas
the Peorias and Kaskaskias and Ottowas, lies the country
of the Shawnees, or Shawanoes. It extends along the line
of the State of Missouri, north, twenty-eight miles to the
Missouri River at its junction with the Konzas, thence
to a point sixty miles on a direct course to the lands of the
Kauzaus, thence south on the Kauzaus line six miles, and
from these lines, with a breadth of about nineteen miles to
a north and south line, one hundred and twenty miles west
of the State of Missouri, {140} containing 1,600,000 acres.
Their principal settlements are on the north-east corner of
their country, between the Missouri border and the Konzas
River. Most of them live in neatly hewn log-cabins, erected
by themselves, and partially supplied with furniture of their
own manufacture. Their fields are inclosed with rail-fences,
and sufficiently large to yield plentiful supplies of
corn and culinary vegetables. They keep cattle and swine,
work oxen, and use horses for draught, and own some
ploughs, waggons and carts. They have a saw and grist-mill,
erected by government at an expense of about &pound;1,600.
This, like many other emigrant tribes, is much scattered.
Besides the two bands on the Neosho, already mentioned,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
there is one on Trinity River, in Texas, and others in divers
places.</p>

<p>Under the superintendence of Missionaries of various
denominations, these people are making considerable progress
in Education and the Mechanic Arts. They have a
printing press among them, from which is issued a monthly
periodical, entitled the "Shauwawnoue Kesauthwau"&mdash;Shawanoe
Sun.<a name="FNanchor_84" id="FNanchor_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a></p>

<p>The lands of the Delawares lie north of the Shawanots, in
the forks of the Konzas {141} and Missouri Rivers; extending
up the former to the Kauzaus lands, thence north
twenty-four miles, to the north-east corner of the Kauzaus
survey, up the Missouri twenty-three miles, in a direct
course to Cantonment Leavenworth, thence with a line
westward to a point ten miles north of the north-east corner
of the Kauzaus survey, and then a slip not more than ten
miles wide, it extends westwardly along the northern boundary
of the Kauzaus, two-hundred and ten miles from the
State of Missouri.</p>

<p>They live in the eastern portion of their country, near
the junction of the Konzas and Missouri Rivers; have
good hewn log-houses, and some furniture in them; in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>close
their fields with rail fences; keep cattle and hogs;
apply horses to draught; use oxen and ploughs; cultivate
corn and garden vegetables, sufficient for use: have commenced
the culture of wheat; and own a grist and saw-mill,
erected by the United States. Some of these people remain
in the Lake country; a few are in Texas; about one-hundred
reside on the Choctaw lands near Arkansas River,
one hundred and twenty miles west of the state of Arkansas.
These latter have acquired the {142} languages of the
Cumanches, Keaways, Pawnees, &amp;c., and are extensively
employed as interpreters by traders from the Indian Territory.
The Treaty of September, 1829, provides that thirty-six
sections of the <i>best</i> land within the district at that time
ceded to the United States, be selected and sold, and the proceeds
applied to the support of Schools for the education of
Delaware children. In the year 1838, the Delawares agreed
to a commutation of two dollars per acre, which secures to
them an Education Fund of &pound;9,000.<a name="FNanchor_85" id="FNanchor_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a></p>

<p>The country of the Kauzaus lies on the Konzas River. It
commences sixty miles west of the State of Missouri, and
thence, in a width of thirty miles, extends westward as far as
the plains can be inhabited. It is well watered and timbered;
and in every respect delightful. They are a lawless, dissolute
race. Formerly they committed many depredations<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
upon their own traders, and other persons ascending the
Missouri River. But, being latterly restrained in this
regard by the United States, they have turned their predatory
operations upon their red neighbours. In language,
habits and condition in life, they are in effect the same as
the Osages. In {143} matters of peace and war, the two
tribes are blended. They are virtually one people.</p>

<p>Like the Osages, the Kauzaus are ignorant and wretched
in the extreme; uncommonly servile, and easily managed by
the white men who reside among them.<a name="FNanchor_86" id="FNanchor_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a> Almost all of
them live in villages of straw, bark, flag and earth huts.
These latter are in the form of a cone; wall two feet in
thickness, supported by wooden pillars within. Like the
other huts, these have no floor except the earth. The fire
is built in the centre of the interior area. The smoke
escapes at an opening in the apex of the cone. The door is
a mere hole, through which they crawl, closed by the skin
of some animal suspended therein.<a name="FNanchor_87" id="FNanchor_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a> They cultivate small
patches of corn, beans and melons. They dig the ground
with hoes and sticks. Their fields generally, are not fenced.
They have one, however, of three hundred acres, which
the United States six years ago ploughed and fenced for
them. The principal Chiefs have log-houses built by the
Government Agent.</p>

<p>It is encouraging, however, to know that these miserable
creatures are beginning to yield to the elevating influences
around {144} them. A missionary has induced some of
them to leave the villages, make separate settlements, build
log-houses, &amp;c. The United States have furnished them
with four yoke of oxen, one waggon, and other means of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>cultivating the soil. They have succeeded in stealing a
large number of horses and mules; own a very few hogs;
no stock cattle. By a treaty formed with them in 1825,
thirty-six sections, or 23,040 acres, of good land were to be
selected and sold to educate Kauzaus children within
their territory. But proper care not having been taken
in making the selection, 9,000 acres only have been sold.
The remaining 14,040 acres of the tract, it is said, will
scarcely sell at any price, so utterly worthless is it. Hence
only &pound;2,250 have been realised from this munificent
appropriation. By the same treaty, provision was made
for the application of &pound;120 per annum, to aid them in
agriculture.<a name="FNanchor_88" id="FNanchor_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a></p>

<p>The Kickapoo lands lie on the north of the Delawares;
extend up the Missouri river thirty miles direct, thence westward
about forty five miles, and thence south twenty miles
to the Delaware line, embracing 768,000 acres.</p>

<p>They live on the south-eastern extremity {145} of their
lands, near Cantonment Leavenworth.<a name="FNanchor_89" id="FNanchor_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a> In regard to
civilization, their condition is similar to that of the Peorias.
They are raising a surplus of the grains, &amp;c. have cattle and
hogs, &pound;140 worth of the latter, and three hundred and forty
head of the former from the United States, in obedience to
treaty stipulations; have about thirty yoke of oxen, fourteen
yoke of them purchased chiefly with the produce of
their farms; have a saw and grist mill, erected by the United
States. Nearly one-half of the tribe are unsettled and scattered,
some in Texas, others with the southern tribes, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>still others ranging the mountains. The treaty of October
24th, 1832, provides that the United States shall pay &pound;100
per annum for ten successive years, for the support of a
school, purchase of books, &amp;c. for the benefit of the Kickapoo
tribe on their own lands. A schoolhouse and teacher
have been furnished in conformity with this stipulation.
The same treaty provides &pound;200 for labour and improvements
on the Kickapoo lands.<a name="FNanchor_90" id="FNanchor_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a></p>

<p>The Sauks, and Reynards or Foxes, speak the same language,
and are so perfectly consolidated by intermarriages
and other ties of interest, as, in fact, to be one nation.<a name="FNanchor_91" id="FNanchor_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span></p>

<p>{146} They formerly owned the north-western half of the
State of Illinois, and a large part of the State of Missouri.
No Indian tribe, except the Sioux, has shown such daring
intrepidity, and such implacable hatred towards other
tribes. Their enmity, when once excited, was never known
to be appeased, till the arrow and tomahawk had for ever
prostrated their foes. For centuries the prairies of Illinois
and Iowa were the theatre of their exterminating prowess;
and to them is to be attributed the almost entire destruction
of the Missouris, the Illinois, Cahokias, Kaskaskias, and
Peorias. They were, however, steady and sincere in their
friendship to the whites; and many is the honest old settler
on the borders of their old dominion, who mentions with
the warmest feelings, the respectful treatment he has received
from them, while he cut the logs for his cabin, and
ploughed his "potato patch" on that lonely and unprotected
frontier.</p>

<p>Like all the tribes, however, this also dwindles away at
the approach of the whites. A melancholy fact. The
Indians' bones must enrich the soil, before the plough of
civilized man can open it. The noble heart, educated by
the tempest to {147} endure the last pang of departing life
without a cringe of a muscle; that heart educated by his
condition to love with all the powers of being, and to hate
with the exasperated malignity of a demon; that heart,
educated by the voice of its own existence&mdash;the sweet
whisperings of the streams&mdash;the holy flowers of spring-<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>to
trust in, and adore the Great producing and sustaining
Cause of itself, and the broad world and the lights of the
upper skies, must fatten the corn hills of a more civilized
race! The sturdy plant of the wilderness droops under the
enervating culture of the garden. The Indian is buried
with his arrows and bow.</p>

<p>In 1832 their friendly relations with their white neighbours
were, I believe, for the first time, seriously interrupted. A
treaty had been formed between the chiefs of the tribe and
commissioners, representing the United States, containing,
among other stipulations, the sale of their lands north of
the Rock River, &amp;c. in the State of Illinois. This tract of
country contained the old villages and burial-places of the
tribe. It was, indeed, the sanctuary of all that was venerable
and sacred among them. They wintered and summered
there long before the date of their historical legends. And
on {148} these flowering plains the spoils of war&mdash;the
loves of early years&mdash;every thing that delights man to
remember of the past, clung closely to the tribe, and made
them dissatisfied with the sale. Black-Hawk was the principal
chief. He, too, was unwilling to leave his village in a
charming glen, at the mouth of Rock River, and increased
the dissatisfaction of his people by declaring that "the white
chiefs had deceived himself and the other contracting chiefs"
in this, "that he had never, and the other chiefs had never
consented to such a sale as the white chiefs had written, and
were attempting to enforce upon them." They dug up the
painted tomahawk with great enthusiasm, and fought
bravely by their noble old chief for their beautiful home.
But, in the order of nature, the plough must bury the hunter.
And so it was with this truly great chief and his brave tribe.
They were driven over the Mississippi to make room for the
marshalled host of veteran husbandmen, whose strong
blows had levelled the forests of the Atlantic States; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>
yet unwearied with planting the rose on the brow of the
wilderness, demanded that the Prairies also should yield
food to their hungry sickles.<a name="FNanchor_92" id="FNanchor_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a></p>

<p>{149} The country assigned them as their permanent
residence, adjoins the southern boundary of the Kickapoos,
and on the north and north east the Missouri river. They
are but little improved. Under treaty stipulations, they
have some few houses and fields made for them by the United
States, and are entitled to more. Some live stock has been
given them, and more is to be furnished. The main body
of the Sauks, usually denominated the Sauks and Foxes,
estimated at four thousand six hundred souls, reside on the
Iowa river, in Iowa Territory. They will ultimately be
removed to unappropriated lands adjoining those already
occupied by their kindred within the Indian Territory.
Both these bands number twelve thousand four hundred.
By the treaty of Prairie du Chien of 1830, the Sauks are
entitled to &pound;100 a year for the purposes of education. By
treaty of September, 1836, they are entitled to a schoolmaster,
a farmer, and blacksmith, as long as the United
States shall deem proper. Three comfortable houses are
to be erected for them, two hundred acres of prairie land
fenced and ploughed, such agricultural implements furnished
as they may need for five years, one ferry-boat, two hundred
and {150} five head of cattle, one hundred stock hogs, and
a flouring mill. These benefits they are receiving, but are
making an improvident use of them.</p>

<p>The country of the Iowas contains one hundred and
twenty-eight thousand acres adjoining the north eastern
boundaries of the Sauks, with the Missouri river on the
north east, and the great Nemaha river on the north. Their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>
condition is similar to that of the Sauks. The aid which
they have received, and are to receive from the government,
is about the same in proportion to their numbers. The
villages of the Sauks and Iowas, are within two miles of
each other.<a name="FNanchor_93" id="FNanchor_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a></p>

<p>The Otoes are the descendants of the Missouris, with
whom they united after the reduction of the latter tribe by
the Sauks and Foxes. They claim a portion of land lying
in the fork between Missouri and Great Platte rivers. The
government of the United States understand, however, that
their lands extend southward from the Platte down the
Missouri to Little Nemaha river, a distance of about forty
miles; thence their southern boundary extends westward up
Little Nemaha to its source, and thence due west. Their
western and northern boundaries are not particularly {151}
defined. Their southern boundary is about twenty-five
miles north of the Iowa's land.<a name="FNanchor_94" id="FNanchor_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a></p>

<p>By treaty, such of their tribe as are related to the whites,
have an interest in a tract adjoining the Missouri river, and
extending from the Little Nemaha to the Great Nemaha, a
length of about twenty-eight miles, and ten miles wide.
No Indians reside on this tract.</p>

<p>The condition of this people is similar to that of the
Osages and Kauzaus. The United States Government
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>has fenced and ploughed for them one hundred and thirty
acres of land. In 1838, they cultivated three hundred
acres of corn. They own six ploughs, furnished by Government.
Their progenitors, the Missouris, were, when the
French first knew the country, the most numerous tribe in
the vicinity of Saint Louis; and the great stream, on whose
banks they reside, and the State which has risen upon their
hunting grounds when the race is extinct, will bear their
name to the generations of coming time. They are said
to have been an energetic and thrifty race before they were
visited by the small-pox, and the destroying vengeance of
the Sauks and Foxes. The site of their ancient village is to
be seen on the north bank of the {152} river, honoured with
their name, just below where Grand river now enters it.<a name="FNanchor_95" id="FNanchor_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a>
Their territory embraced the fertile country lying a considerable
distance along the Missouri, above their village&mdash;and
down to the mouth of the Osage, and thence to the Mississippi.
The Osages consider them their inferiors, and treat
them oftentimes with great indignity.</p>

<p>The Omahas own the country north of the mouth of the
Great Platte. The Missouri river is considered its north-eastern
limit; the northern and western boundaries are
undefined. This tribe was formerly the terror of their
neighbours. They had, in early times, about one thousand
warriors, and a proportionate number of women and children.
But the small-pox visited them in 1802, and reduced
the tribe to about three hundred souls. This so disheartened
those who survived, that they burnt their village and became
a wandering people. They have at last taken possession<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
again of their country, and built a village on the south-west
bank of the Missouri, at a place chosen for them by
the United States. Their huts are constructed of earth,
like those of the Otoes. A treaty made with them in July,
1830, provides that an annuity of five hundred {153} dollars
shall be paid to them in agricultural implements, for ten
years thereafter, and longer if the President of the United
States thinks proper. A blacksmith also, is to be furnished
them for the same length of time. Another treaty obliges
the United States to plough and fence one hundred acres of
land for them, and to expend, for the term of ten years,
&pound;100 annually, in educating Omaha children.<a name="FNanchor_96" id="FNanchor_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a></p>

<p>The Puncahs, or Ponsars, are the remnant of a nation of
respectable importance, formerly living upon Red river, of
Lake Winnipeg. Having been nearly destroyed by the
Sioux, they removed to the west side of the Missouri river,
where they built a fortified village, and remained some
years; but being pursued by their ancient enemies, the
Sioux, and reduced by continual wars, they joined the
Omahas, and so far lost their original character as to be
undistinguished from them. They, however, after a while,
resumed a separate existence, which they continue to maintain.
They reside in the northern extremity of the Indian
Territory.<a name="FNanchor_97" id="FNanchor_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a> Their circumstances are similar to those of
the Pawnees.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span></p>

<p>The Pawnees own an extensive country lying west of the
Otoes and Omahas, on {154} the Great Platte river. Their
villages are upon this stream and its lower tributaries.
They are said to have about two thousand five hundred
warriors. Among them are still to be found every custom of
old Indian life. The earth-hut, the scalping-knife, the
tomahawk, and the scalps of their foes dangling from the
posts in their smoky dwellings, the wild war cries, the venerated
medicine bag, with the calumet of peace, the sacred

<p>These are the emigrant and native Indians within the
"Indian Territory," and their several conditions and circumstances,
so far as I have been able to learn them. The
other Indians in the Great Prairie Wilderness will be briefly
noticed under two divisions&mdash;those living south, and those
living north of the Great Platte river.</p>

<p>There are living on the head waters of Red river, and
between that river and the {156} Rio Bravo del Norte, the
remains of twelve different tribes&mdash;ten of which have an
average population of two hundred souls; none of them
number more than four hundred. The Carankouas and
Tetaus, or Cumanches, are more numerous. The former
live about the Bay of St. Bernard. They were always inimical
to the Mexicans and Spaniards; never would succumb
to their authority, or receive their religious teachers. And
many hard battles were fought in maintaining their independence
in these respects. In 1817, they amounted to
about three thousand, of which six hundred were warriors.<a name="FNanchor_99" id="FNanchor_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a></p>

<p>The Cumanches are supposed to be twenty thousand
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>strong. They are a brave vagrant tribe, and never reside
but a few days in a place, but travel north with the buffalo
in the summer, and, as winter comes on, return with them
to the plains west of Texas. They traverse the immense
space of country extending from the Trinity and Brazos to
the Red River, and the head waters of the Arkansas, and
Colorado to the west, to the Pacific Ocean, and thence to
the head streams of the Missouri, and thence to their winter
haunts. They have tents made of neatly dressed skins,
in the form of cones. These, when they stop, are pitched
so as to {157} form streets and squares. They pitch and
strike these tents in an astonishingly short space of time.
To every tent is attached two pack-horses, the one to carry
the tent, and the other the polished cedar poles with which
it is spread. These loaded in a trice&mdash;the saddle horses
harnessed in still less time&mdash;twenty thousand savages&mdash;men,
women, and children, warriors and chiefs&mdash;start at
a signal whoop, travel the day, again raise their city of tents
to rest and feed themselves and animals for another march.<a name="FNanchor_100" id="FNanchor_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a></p>

<p>Thus passes life with the Cumanches. Their plains are
covered with buffalo, elk, deer, and wild horses. It is said
that they drink the blood of the buffalo warm from the veins.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span></p>
<p>They also eat the liver in its raw state, using the gall as sauce.
The dress of the women is a long loose robe which reaches
from the chin to the ground, made of deer skin dressed very
neatly, and painted with figures of different colours and
significations. The dress of the men is close pantaloons,
and a hunting shirt or frock made of the same beautiful
material. They are a warlike and brave race, and stand in
the relation of conquerors among the tribes in the south.
The Spaniards of New Mexico {158} are all acquainted with
the strength of their enemy, and their power to punish those
whom they hate. For many are the scalps and death-dances
among these Indians, which testify of wars and tomahawks
which have dug tombs for that poor apology of European
extraction. They are exceedingly fond of stealing the
objects of their enemies' affection. Female children are
sought with the greatest avidity, and adopted or married.
"About sixty years ago," as the tale runs, "the daughter
of the Governor-General at Chilhuahua, was stolen by
them. The father immediately pursued, and by an agent,
after some weeks had elapsed, purchased her ransom. But
she refused to return to her parents, and sent them these
words: 'That the Indians had tattooed her face according
to their style of beauty&mdash;had given her to be the wife of a
young man by whom she believed herself enceinte&mdash;that
her husband treated her well, and reconciled her to his
mode of life&mdash;that she would be made more unhappy by
returning to her father under these circumstances, than by
remaining where she was.' She continued to live with her
husband in the nation, and raised a family of children."</p>

<p>{159} There are the remains of fifteen or twenty tribes in
that part of the Great Prairie Wilderness north of the Great
Platte, and north and west of the Indian Territory. They
average about eight hundred each. The Sioux and the
small-pox have reduced them thus.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span></p>

<p>The Knistineaux chiefly reside in the British possessions
along the northern shores of Lake Superior. Some bands
of them have established themselves south of latitude 49&deg;
north, near the head waters of these branches of Red River
of Lake Winnipeg, which rise south of the sources of the
Mississippi. They are moderate in stature, well proportioned,
and of great activity. Mackenzie remarks that
their countenances are frank and agreeable, that the females
are well-formed, and their features are more regular and
comely than those of any other tribe he saw upon the continent.
They are warlike&mdash;number about three thousand;
but the Sioux are annihilating them.<a name="FNanchor_101" id="FNanchor_101"></a><a href="#Footnote_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a></p>

<p>The Sioux claim a country equal in extent to some of the
most powerful empires of Europe. Their boundaries
"commence at the Prairie du Chien, and ascend the
Mississippi on both sides to the River De {160} Corbeau,
and up that to its source, from thence to the sources of
the St. Peter's, thence to the 'Montaigne de la Prairie,'
thence to the Missouri, and down that river to the Omahas,
thence to the sources of the River Des Moines, and thence
to the place of beginning." They also claim a large
territory south of the Missouri.<a name="FNanchor_102" id="FNanchor_102"></a><a href="#Footnote_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span></p>

<p>The country from Rum River<a name="FNanchor_103" id="FNanchor_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a> to the River de Corbeau
is claimed by them and the Chippeways, and has been
the source of many bloody encounters for the past two hundred
years. These Indians have conquered and destroyed
immense numbers of their race. They have swept the
banks of the Missouri from the Great Falls to the mouth of
the Great Platte and the plains that lie north of the latter
stream, between the Black Hills and the Mississippi. They
are divided into six bands, viz.: the Menowa Kontong,
which resides around the falls of St. Anthony, and the
lower portion of St. Peter's River; the Washpetong, still
higher on that stream; the Sussetong, on its head waters
and those of Red River, of Lake Winnipeg; the Yanktons of
the north, who rove over the plains on the borders of the
Missouri valley south of the sources of the St. Peter's;
the Yonktons Ahnah, who {161} live on the Missouri
near the entrance of James River; the Tetons Brulos;
Tetons Okandandas; Tetons Minnekincazzo, and Tetons
Sahone, who reside along the banks of the Missouri from
the Great Bend northward to the villages of the Riccarees.<a name="FNanchor_104" id="FNanchor_104"></a><a href="#Footnote_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a>
Theirs is the country from which is derived the colouring
matter of that river. The plains are strongly impregnated
with Glauber salts, alum, copperas, and sulphur. In the
spring of the year immense bluffs fall in the stream; and
these, together with the leachings from these medicated
prairies, give to the waters their mud colour, and purgative
qualities.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span></p>

<p>These bands comprise about twenty-eight thousand souls.
They subsist upon buffalo meat, and the wild fruits of their
forests. The former is prepared for winter, and for travelling
use, in the following manner:&mdash;The lean parts of the
buffalo are cut into thin slices, dried over a slow fire, in the
sun, or by exposing it to frost&mdash;pounded fine, and then,
with a portion of berries, mixed with an equal quantity
of fat from the humps and brisket, or with marrow, in
a boiling state, and sewed up tightly in sacks of green
hide, or packed closely in baskets of wicker work. This
"pemican," as they call it, will keep {162} for several
years. They also use much of the wild rice, avena fatua,
which grows in great abundance on the St. Peter's, and
among the lakes and head streams of Red River, of Winnipeg,
and in other parts of their territory. It grows in water
from four to seven feet deep with a muddy bottom. The
plant rises from four to eight feet above the surface of the
water, about the size of the red cane of Tennessee, full of
joints, and of the colour and texture of bull-rushes: the
stalks above the water, and the branches which bear the
grain, resemble oats.<a name="FNanchor_105" id="FNanchor_105"></a><a href="#Footnote_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a></p>

<p>To these strange grain fields the wild duck and geese
resort for food in the summer. And to prevent it from
being devoured by them, the Indians tie it, when the kernel
is in the milky state, just below the head, into large
bunches. This arrangement prevents these birds from
pressing the heads down within their reach. When ripe,
the Indians pass among it with canoes lined with blankets,
into which they bend the stalks, and whip off the grain with
sticks; and so abundant is it, that an expert squaw will soon
fill a canoe. After being gathered, it is dried and put into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>
skins or baskets for use. They boil or parch it, and eat it in
the winter season {163} with their pemican. This plant
is found no farther south than Illinois, no farther east than
Sandusky Bay, and north nearly to Hudson's Bay. The
rivers and lakes of the Sioux and Chippeway country are
said to produce annually several million bushels of it. It
is equally as nutritious and palatable as the Carolina rice.
Carver also says that the St. Peter's flows through a country
producing spontaneously all the necessaries of life in the
greatest abundance. Besides the wild rice, he informs us
that every part of the valley of that river "is filled with trees
bending under their loads of plums, grapes, and apples;
the meadows with hops, and many sorts of vegetables,
while the ground is stored with edible roots, and covered
with such amazing quantities of sugar-maple, that they
would produce sugar enough for any number of inhabitants."<a name="FNanchor_106" id="FNanchor_106"></a><a href="#Footnote_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a></p>

<p>Mr. Carver seems to have been, to say the least, rather
an enthusiastic admirer of nature; and although later
travellers in the country of the Naudowessies (Sioux) have
not been able to find grouped within it all the fruits and
flowers of an Eden, yet that their lands lying on the Mississippi,
the St. Peter's, and the Red Rivers, produce a luxurious
vegetation, groves of fine timber separated {164} by open
plains of the rich wild grasses, and by lakes and streams
of pure water well stored with fish; that there are many
valuable edible roots there: and the whortleberry, blackberry,
wild plum and crab-apple, other and later travellers
have seen and declared; so that no doubt can be entertained
that this talented and victorious tribe possess a very desirable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>
and beautiful country. A revolted band of the Sioux
called Osinipoilles, live near the Rocky Mountains upon the
Sascatchiwine river, a pleasant champaign country, abounding
in game. They subsist by the chase, and the spoils of
war. Their number is estimated to be eight thousand.
Their dwellings are neat conical tents of tanned buffalo
skins.<a name="FNanchor_107" id="FNanchor_107"></a><a href="#Footnote_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a></p>

<p>The Chippewyans or Chippeways, were supposed by
Lewis and Clark to inhabit the country lying between the
60th and 65th parallels of north latitude, and 100&deg; and 110&deg;
of west longitude.<a name="FNanchor_108" id="FNanchor_108"></a><a href="#Footnote_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a> Other authorities, and I believe more
correct, assert that they also occupy the head waters of the
Mississippi, Ottertail, and Leach, De Corbeau and Red
rivers, and Winnipeg lake. They are a numerous tribe,
speak a copious language, are timorous, vagrant, and
selfish; stature rather low; features coarse; hair {165} lank,
and not unfrequently a sunburnt brown; women more
agreeable (and who can doubt the fact) than the men; but
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>have an awkward gait; which proceeds from their being
accustomed, nine months in the year, to wear snow shoes,
and drag sledges of a weight from two hundred to four
hundred pounds. They are entirely submissive to their
husbands; and for very trifling causes are treated with
such cruelty as to produce death! These people betroth
their children when quite young; and when they arrive at
puberty the ceremony of marriage is performed; that is, the
bridegroom pays the market price for his bride, and takes
her to his lodge, not "for better or for worse," but to put
her away and take another when he pleases. Plurality
of wives is customary among them. They generally wear
the hair long. The braves sometimes clip it in fantastic
forms. The women always wear it of great length, braided
in two queues, and dangling down the back. Jealous
husbands sometimes despoil them of these tresses. Both
sexes make from one to four bars of lines upon the forehead
or cheeks, by drawing a thread dipped in the proper
colour beneath the skin of those parts.</p>

<p>{166} No people are more attentive to comfort in dress
than the Chippeways. It is composed of deer and fawn
skins, dressed with the hair on, for the winter, and without
the hair for the summer wear. The male wardrobe consists
of shoes, leggings, frock and cap, &amp;c. The shoes are
made in the usual moccasin form, save that they sometimes
use the green instead of the tanned hide. The leggings are
made like the legs of pantaloons unconnected by a waistband.
They reach to the waist; and are supported by a
belt. Under the belt a small piece of leather is drawn,
which serves as an apron before and behind. The shoes
and leggings are sewed together. In the former are put
quantities of moose and reindeer hair; and additional
pieces of leather as socks. The frock or hunting shirt is
in the form of a peasant's frock. When girded around the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>
waist it reaches to the middle of the thigh. The mittens
are sewed to the sleeves, or suspended by strings from the
shoulders. A kind of tippet surrounds the neck. The skin
of the deer's head furnishes a curious covering to the head;
and a robe made of several deer or fawn skins sewed
together, covers the whole. This dress is worn single or
double, as circumstances suggest; but in {167} winter the
hair side of the undersuit is worn next the person, and that
of the outer one without. Thus arrayed, the Chippeway
will lay himself down on the ice, in the middle of a lake,
and repose in comfort; and when rested, and disencumbered
of the snow-drifts which have covered him while
asleep, he mounts his snow shoes, and travels on without
fear of frosts or storm. The dress of the women differs
from that of the men. Their leggings are tied below the
knee; and their frock or chemise extends down to the ankle.
Mothers make these garments large enough about the
shoulders to hold an infant; and when travelling carry
their little ones upon their backs next the skin.</p>

<p>Their arms and domestic apparatus, in addition to guns,
&amp;c., obtained from the whites, are bows and arrows, fishing-nets,
and lines made of green deer-skin thongs, and nets of
the same material for catching the beaver, as he escapes
from his lodge into the water; and sledges and snow-shoes.
The snow-shoes are of very superior workmanship. The
inner part of the frame is straight; the outer one curved;
the ends are brought to a point, and in front turned up.
This frame done, they are neatly placed {168} with light
thongs of deer-skin. Their sledges are made of red fir-tree
boards, neatly polished and turned up in front. The means
of sustaining life in the country claimed by these Indians are
abundant; and if sufficient forethought were used in laying
in food for winter, they might live in comparative comfort.
The woodless hills are covered with a moss that sustains the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>
deer and moose and reindeer; and when boiled, forms a
gelatinous substance very acceptable to the human palate.<a name="FNanchor_109" id="FNanchor_109"></a><a href="#Footnote_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a>
Their streams and lakes are stored with the greatest abundance
of valuable fish. But although more provident than
any other Indians on the continent, they often suffer severely
in the dead of winter, when, to prevent death from cold,
they fly from their fishing stations to their scanty woods.</p>

<p>They are superstitious in the extreme. Almost every
action of their lives is influenced by some whimsical notion.
They believe in the existence of a good and evil spirit, that
rule in their several departments over the fortunes of men;
and in a state of future rewards and punishments. They
have an order of priests who administer the rites of their
religion&mdash;offer sacrifices at their solemn feasts, &amp;c.<a name="FNanchor_110" id="FNanchor_110"></a><a href="#Footnote_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a>
They have conjurors {169} who cure diseases&mdash;as rheumatism,
flux and consumption.</p>

<p>"The notion which these people entertain of the creation
is of a very singular nature. They believe that at first the
earth was one vast and entire ocean, inhabited by no living
creature except a mighty Bird, whose eyes were fire, whose
glances were lightning, and the flapping of whose wings
was thunder. On his descent to the ocean, and touching
it, the earth instantly arose, and remained on the surface
of the waters. This omnipotent Bird then called forth all
the variety of animals from the earth except the Chippeways,
who were produced from a dog. And this circumstance
occasions their aversion to the flesh of that animal, as well
as the people who eat it. This extraordinary tradition
proceeds to relate that the great Bird, having finished his
work, made an arrow, which was to be preserved with
great care and to remain untouched; but that the Chippeways
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>were so devoid of understanding as to carry it away;
and the sacrilege so enraged the great Bird that he has
never since appeared."</p>

<p>"They have also a tradition among them that they originally
came from another {170} country, inhabited by very
wicked people, and had traversed a great lake, which was
narrow, shallow and full of islands, where they had suffered
great misery&mdash;it being always winter, with ice and deep
snow. At the Coppermine River, where they had made
the first land, the ground was covered with copper, over
which a body of earth had since been collected to the depth
of a man's height. They believe, also, that in ancient times
their ancestors lived till their feet were worn out with walking,
and their throats with eating. They describe a deluge
when the waters spread over the whole earth, except the
highest mountains, on the top of which they preserved
themselves. They believe that immediately after their
death they pass into another world, where they arrive at a
large river, on which they embark in a stone canoe; and
that a gentle current bears them on to an extensive lake,
in the centre of which is a most beautiful island; and that
in view of this delightful abode they receive that judgement
for their conduct during life, which determines their
final state and unalterable allotment. If their good actions
are declared to predominate, they are landed upon the
island, where there is to be no {171} end to their happiness;
which, however, to their notion, consists in an eternal enjoyment
of sensual pleasure and carnal gratification. But
if there be bad actions to weigh down the balance, the stone
canoe sinks at once, and leaves them up to their chins in
water, to behold and regret the reward enjoyed by the good,
and eternally struggling, but with unavailing endeavours,
to reach the blissful island from which they are excluded for
ever."</p>

<p>It would be interesting, in closing this notice of the Great
Prairie wilderness, to give an account of the devoted Missionaries
of the various denominations who are labouring to
cultivate the Indian in a manner which at once bespeaks
their good sense and honest intentions. But, as it would
require more space and time than can be devoted to it,
merely to present a skeleton view of their multifarious
doings, I shall only remark, in passing, that they appear to
have adopted, in their plan of operations, the principle
that to civilize these people, one of the first steps is to create
and gratify those physical wants peculiar to the civilized
state; and also, that the most successful means of civilizing
their mental state, is to teach them a language which
is {172} filled with the learning, sciences, and the religion
which has civilized Europe, that they may enter at once,
and with the fullest vigour into the immense harvests of
knowledge and virtue which past ages and superior races
have prepared for them.</p>

more into harmony with the Cherokee constitution, which was modelled upon
that of Mississippi. The modified document provided for a single executive,
called the principal chief, elected for two years, and ineligible for more than four
years in six; two houses of legislature; courts of judiciary, etc. After the War
of Secession this constitution was further amended, slavery being then abolished.
In 1897 the Choctaw entered into the Atoka agreement with the commission to
the Five Civilized Tribes, whereby the judicial functions of their tribal government
have passed to the United States courts erected in the territory. Tribal
government itself was to have ceased March 6, 1906; at that time, all lands
being allotted, it was expected that the Choctaw became full-fledged American
citizens. But owing to complications involved in settling the estates, an act of
postponement was passed by Congress in the spring of that year, providing that
"tribal existence and present tribal governments are continued in full force until
otherwise provided by law." See article, "The End of the Civilized Tribes," in

Lower Creeks. The former were the chief aggressors in the Creek War of 1813,
which was in fact largely a civil outbreak. General William McIntosh, halfbreed
son of Roderick McIntosh, a Highland emigrant to West Florida, was an
influential chief of the Lower Creeks and loyal to the Americans. He led the
party favoring removal to Indian Territory, and signed the treaty of Indian
Springs (1825) whereupon he was put to death by the band opposed to emigration.
His sons Chilly and Rolly McIntosh became leaders of the emigration
party and removed west of the Mississippi (1826-27). One of the chiefs of the
Eastern band was Little Doctor, who volunteered to aid the United States in the
Seminole War (1835-42). He came west with his band about 1836. It was not
until 1867 that the two factions united under a written constitution and a republican
form of government.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p></div>

After the Creek War (1813-14) the majority of the hostiles made their way to the
Seminole. When attempt was made to remove these tribesmen to Indian Territory
(1832-34), they resisted sharply and finally war broke out which was prolonged
until 1842. As various bands surrendered to the United States or were
captured, they were sent out to the territory, so that by 1839 (the year of Farnham's
journey) there were nineteen hundred Seminole among the Creeks. In
1856 they attempted autonomy, and with the consent of the United States bought
200,000 acres of Creek land; two years later the remainder of the band from Florida,
under their chief Bowlegs, came out and joined their tribe. In 1881-82 they
added 175,000 acres to their tract.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p></div>

1831 they agreed to remove to the Kansas region, and emigration thither was completed
about 1836. Their reservation grew valuable and in 1867 the Ottawa
made a treaty with the federal government whereby in five years their lands were
to be allotted, and the residue sold. Finding their position uncomfortable, they
petitioned for a reservation and the remnant of the tribe removed to that of the
Quapaw, in Indian Territory, where about two hundred now live on recently
allotted lands. There is no evidence that any considerable number of Michigan
Ottawa ever migrated to Kansas.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p></div>

In 1825 they relinquished this grant for the Kansas reservation described
by Farnham, where they were joined (1832-33) by the remainder of the tribe from
Ohio. In 1854 they ceded their lands to the federal government, save a reservation
of 200,000 acres, where they established a form of government and made
a body of laws. In 1869 about the half of the tribe bought lands of the Cherokee,
and became incorporated with the latter tribe. A small band known as
Eastern Shawnee are on the Quapaw reservation, while the remainder have been
allotted lands in Oklahoma, near the town of Shawnee. Methodists, Baptists,
and Friends all established missions for the Shawnee&mdash;see our volume xxvii,
p. 194, note 72 (De Smet), for the first-named denomination. The Baptist
mission, begun in 1831, had a printing press (1834) whereupon Rev. Jotham

the Louisiana Purchase (1803) several bands had gone west of the Mississippi.
In 1818 they ceded all their lands in the East, and migrated to Missouri,
where they lived upon James Fork of White River, near the present Springfield.
In 1829 they were given a large cession between the Kansas and Missouri rivers,
which they possessed until 1854. After the treaty of cession in that year, they
preserved a considerable reservation, which was sold (1866) to the Union Pacific
Railway Company, whereupon they bought land of the Cherokee, and became
incorporated into the latter tribe, although in certain relations maintaining autonomy.
The band that removed farther west (1829) are still among the Wichita,
at Kiowa Agency. At the close of Wayne's campaign (1794-95), a considerable

for the tract described by Farnham; see our volume xxii, p. 254, note 206. This

Brown County, Kansas. The Kickapoo have always been wanderers; about

85; or more particularly, <i>Wisconsin Historical Collections</i>, xvi, xvii. About the
beginning of the nineteenth century they were located on both banks of the Mississippi,
from the mouth of the Wisconsin down to the mouth of the Missouri.
By the treaty of 1804 a large amount of land was ceded to the United States, but
the cession was repudiated by many of the tribe; during the War of 1812-15, these
protestants were among the hostiles. Treaties of peace (1815 and 1816) were
concluded with the two divisions of the tribe&mdash;the Missouri and Rock River
bands respectively. By the treaties of 1824, 1830, and 1836, the former relinquished
all their Missouri territory for a reservation in Kansas and Nebraska,
north of the Kickapoo; see Townsend's <i>Narrative</i> in our volume xxi, p. 122,
note 2. This was largely reduced by the treaty of 1861; so that there is now but
a small reservation in northern Brown County, Kansas, where about eighty of
the Missouri band still live and maintain a day school. The Rock River band
divided into two factions, under Keokuk and Black Hawk. The latter waged war
with the United States in 1832 (see Thwaites, "Black Hawk War," in <i>How George
Rogers Clark won the North-west</i>, pp. 115-198), after which a large cession of lands
was made. These the tribesmen attempted to recover (1836), but by 1842 they
had ceded all their Iowa lands. Migration had already begun (1840) to Kansas,
where they settled upon Marais des Cygnes, in Osage County, the last Foxes
removing thither in 1847. Here the confederacy between the allied tribes, after
existing for over a hundred years, began to dissolve. The Sauk largely removed
to Indian Territory, and in 1904 four hundred and ninety-one were dwelling upon
allotted lands in Oklahoma. The Foxes had begun in 1853 to return to Iowa
in small bands. Ingratiating themselves with the settlers, they purchased lands
on Iowa River, in Tama County; but not until 1867 did the federal government
recognize these as their legal residence. There are now about three hundred and
fifty in this locality, somewhat progressive&mdash;owning wagons, sewing-machines,
typewriters, etc.&mdash;but still clinging to traditional customs, probably the most
conservative of all tribesmen who have been so long in contact with the whites.

former. In 1854 and 1861 they ceded most of their new reservation, a small band

<p><a name="Footnote_99" id="Footnote_99"></a><a href="#FNanchor_99"><span class="label">[99]</span></a> The Karankawa (Carancahua) were a tribe of Texan Indians whose habitat
was the bays and river-openings of the coast south and west from Galveston.
They were first known to Europeans through contact with La Salle's colonists,
whose remnant they captured. In the eighteenth century the Spanish attempted
several missions to this people, but without much success; their contact with
whites appeared to have made them more sanguinary and ferocious, and increased
their tendencies to cannibalism. Bad treatment by Lafitte's pirate colony made
them hostile to the Austin settlers, who in 1825 rallied and inflicted upon them
a severe defeat. They made part of the Mexican army in the attack on the Alamo,
and after the conclusion of the war kept peace with the Texans through fear of
the latter's revenge. Successive hostilities, however, weakened their strength
and numbers, and after 1836 the few survivors took refuge in Mexico. There a
remnant existed for some years, an attack upon them by some rancheros of Texas,
in revenge for robbery, being noted as late as 1858. The tribe is now extinct,
but a vocabulary and a knowledge of their manners and customs have been preserved.

Saulteurs, see our volume ii, p. 79, note 38) are the largest and most important
branch of the Algonquian family, first being encountered by the French at the outlet
of Lake Superior. According to tradition, their original habitat was the St.
Lawrence, whence they passed slowly westward to the Great Lakes. At Lake
Superior they divided, one portion going north and west to Lake Winnipeg, the
other following the southern shore of the lake. For many years their chief settlement
was at La Pointe on Chequamegon Bay. As allies of the French they
joined in the French and Indian War and in Pontiac's Conspiracy&mdash;see J. Bain

<p>Fort William, or Bent's Fort, on the north side of the
Arkansas, eighty miles north by east from Taos in the Mexican
dominions, and about one hundred and sixty miles
from the mountains, was erected by gentlemen owners in
1832, for purposes of trade with the Spaniards of Santa
F&eacute; and Taos, and the Eutaw, Cheyenne and Cumanche
Indians. It is in the form of a parallelogram, the northern<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>
and southern sides of which are about a hundred and fifty
feet, and the eastern and western a hundred feet in length.
The walls are six or seven feet in thickness at the base, and
seventeen or eighteen feet in height. The fort is entered
through {174} a large gateway on the eastern side, in which
swing a pair of immense plank doors. At the north-west
and south-east corners stand two cylindrical bastions,
about ten feet in diameter and thirty feet in height.</p>

<p>These are properly perforated for the use of cannon and
small arms; and command the fort and the plains around
it. The interior area is divided into two parts. The one
and the larger of them occupies the north-eastern portion.
It is nearly a square. A range of two-story houses, the
well, and the blacksmith's shop are on the north side; on
the west and south are ranges of one-story houses; on the
east the blacksmith's shop, the gate and the outer wall.
This is the place of business. Here the owners and their
servants have their sleeping and cooking apartments, and
here are the storehouses. In this area the Indians in the
season of trade gather in large numbers and barter, and
trade, and buy, under the guardianship of the carronades
of the bastions loaded with grape, and looking upon them.
From this area a passage leads between the eastern outer
wall and the one-story houses, to the caral or cavy-yard,
which occupies the remainder of the space within the walls.
This is the {175} place for the horses, mules, &amp;c., to repose
in safety from Indian depredations at night. Beyond the
caral to the west and adjoining the wall, is the waggon-house.
It is strongly built, and large enough to shelter
twelve or fifteen of those large vehicles which are used in
conveying the peltries to St. Louis, and goods thence to
the post. The long drought of summer renders it necessary
to protect them from the sun.</p>

<p>The walls of the fort, its bastions and houses, are con<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>structed
of adobies or unburnt bricks, cemented together
with a mortar of clay. The lower floors of the building
are made of clay, a little moistened and beaten hard with
large wooden mallets; the upper floors of the two-story
houses and the roofs of all are made in the same way and of
the same material, and are supported by heavy transverse
timbers covered with brush. The tops of the houses being
flat and gravelled, furnish a fine promenade in the moonlight
evenings of that charming climate. The number of
men employed in the business of this establishment is supposed
to be about sixty. Fifteen or twenty of them in charge
of one of the owners, are employed in taking to market the
buffalo robes, &amp;c., which are gathered at the fort, {176} and
in bringing back with them new stocks of goods for future
purchases. Another party is employed in hunting buffalo
meat in the neighbouring plains; and another in guarding
the animals while they cut their daily food on the banks of
the river. Others, under command of an experienced
trader, goes into some distant Indian camp to trade. One
or more of the owners, and one or another of these parties
which chances to be at the post, defend it and trade, keep
the books of the company, &amp;c. Each of these parties
encounters dangers and hardships, from which persons
within the borders of civilization would shrink.</p>

<p>The country in which the fort is situated is in a manner
the common field of several tribes, unfriendly alike to one
another and the whites. The Eutaws and Cheyennes<a name="FNanchor_111" id="FNanchor_111"></a><a href="#Footnote_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a> of
the mountains near Santa F&eacute;, and the Pawnees of the great
Platte, come to the Upper Arkansas to meet the buffalo in
their annual migrations to the north; and on the trail of
these animals follow up the Cumanches. And thus in the
months of June, August, and September, there are in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>neighbourhood of these traders from fifteen to twenty
thousand savages ready and panting for {177} plunder and
blood. If they engage in battling out old causes of contention
among themselves, the Messrs. Bents feel comparatively
safe in their solitary fortress. But if they spare each
other's property and lives, they occasion great anxieties at
Fort William; every hour of day and night is pregnant with
danger. These untameable savages may drive beyond
reach the buffalo on which the garrison subsists; may begirt
the fort with their legions, and cut off supplies; may prevent
them from feeding their animals upon the plains; may
bring upon them starvation and the gnawing their own flesh
at the door of death! All these are expectations, which as
yet the ignorance alone of the Indians as to the weakness
of the post, prevents from becoming realities. But at what
moment some chieftain or white desperado may give them
the requisite knowledge, is an uncertainty which occasions
at Fort William many well-grounded fears for life and
property.</p>

<p>Instances of the daring intrepidity of the Cumanches
which occurred just before and after my arrival here, will
serve to show the hazards and dangers of which I have
spoken. About the middle of June, 1839, a band of sixty
of them, under cover of {178} night, crossed the river, and
concealed themselves among the bushes growing thickly
on the bank near the place where the animals of the establishment
feed during the day. No sentinel being on duty at
the time, their presence was unobserved; and when morning
came the Mexican horse-guard mounted his horse, and
with the noise and shouting usual with that class of servants
when so employed, drove his charge out of the fort, and riding
rapidly from side to side of the rear of the band, urged
them on, and soon had them nibbling the short dry grass in
a little vale within grape-shot distance of the guns of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>
bastions. It is customary for a guard of animals about these
trading-posts to take his station beyond his charge; and if
they stray from each other, or attempt to stroll too far,
to drive them together, and thus keep them in the best
possible situation to be hurried hastily to the caral,
should the Indians, or other evil persons, swoop down
upon them. As there is constant danger of this, his horse
is held by a long rope and grazes around him, that he may
be mounted quickly, at the first alarm, for a retreat within
the walls. The faithful guard at Bent's, on the morning of
the disaster {179} I am relating, had dismounted after driving
out his animals, and sat upon the ground, watching with
the greatest fidelity for every call of duty, when these fifty
or sixty Indians sprang from their hiding-places, ran upon
the animals, yelling horribly, and attempted to drive them
across the river. The guard, however, nothing daunted,
mounted quickly, and drove his horse at full speed among
them. The mules and horses hearing his voice amidst
the frightening yells of the savages, immediately started
at a lively pace for the fort; but the Indians were on all
sides, and bewildered them. The guard still pressed them
onward, and called for help; and on they rushed, despite
the efforts of the Indians to the contrary. The battlements
were covered with men. They shouted encouragement
to the brave guard&mdash;"Onward! onward!" and the injunction
was obeyed. He spurred his horse to his greatest speed
from side to side, and whipped the hindermost of the
band with his leading rope. He had saved every animal;
he was within twenty yards of the open gate; he fell; three
arrows from the bows of the Cumanches had cloven his heart.
Relieved of him, the lords of the quiver gathered {180} their
prey, and drove them to the borders of Texas, without injury
to life or limb. I saw this faithful guard's grave. He
had been buried a few days. The wolves had been digging<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
into it. Thus forty or fifty mules and horses, and their
best servant's life, were lost to the Messrs. Bents in a single
day. I have been informed also that those horses and
mules, which my company had taken great pleasure in
recovering for them in the plains, were also stolen in a similar
manner soon after my departure from the post; and
that gentlemen owners were in hourly expectation of an
attack upon the fort itself.</p>

<p>The same liability to the loss of life and property attends
the trading expeditions to the encampments of the tribes.</p>

<p>An anecdote of this service was related to me. An old
trapper was sent from this fort to the Eutaw camp, with a
well-assorted stock of goods, and a body of men to guard it.
After a tedious march among the snows and swollen streams
and declivities of the mountain, he came in sight of the
village. It was situated in a sunken valley, among the
hideously dark cliffs of the Eutaw mountains; and so
small was it, and so deep, that the overhanging heights
{181} not only protected it from the blasts of approaching
winter, but drew to their frozen embrace the falling snows,
and left this valley its grasses and flowers, while their
own awful heads were glittering with perpetual frosts.</p>

<p>The traders encamped upon a small swell of land that
overlooked the smoking wigwams, and sent a deputation to
the chiefs to parley for the privilege of opening a trade with
the tribe. They were received with great haughtiness by
those monarchs of the wilderness, and were asked "why
they had dared to enter the Eutaw mountains without their
permission." Being answered that they "had travelled
from the fort to that place, in order to ask their highnesses'
permission to trade with the Eutaws," the principal chief
replied, that no permission had been given to them to come
there, nor to remain. The interview ended, and the traders
returned to their camp with no very pleasant anticipations<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>
as to the result of their expedition. Their baggage was
placed about for breastworks; their animals drawn in nearer,
and tied firmly to stakes; and a patrol guard stationed, as
the evening shut in. Every preparation for the attack,
which appeared determined upon on the part of the
Indians, being {182} made, they waited for the first ray
of day&mdash;a signal of dreadful havoc among all the tribes&mdash;with
the determined anxiety which fills the bosom,
sharpens the sight, nerves the arm, and opens the ear to
the slightest rustle of a leaf, so remarkably, among the
grave, self-possessed, and brave traders of the Great
Prairie and Mountain Wilderness.</p>

<p>During the first part of the night the Indians hurrying
to and fro through the village, their war speeches and war
dances, and the painting their faces with red and black, in
alternate stripes, and an occasional scout warily approaching
the camp of the whites, indicated an appetite for a conflict
that appeared to fix, with prophetic certainty, the fate
of the traders. Eight hundred Indians to fifty whites,
made fearful odds. The morning light streamed faintly
up the east at last. The traders held their rifles with the
grasp of dying men. Another and another beam kindled
on the dark blue vault, and one by one quenched the stars.
The silence of the tomb rested on the world. They breathed
heavily, with teeth set in terrible resolution. The hour&mdash;the
moment&mdash;had arrived! Behind a projecting ledge,
the dusky forms of three or four hundred Eutaws undulated
near the ground, like herds {183} of bears intent on their
prey. They approached the ledge, and for an instant lay
flat on their faces, and motionless. Two or three of them
gently raised their heads high enough to look over upon the
camp of the whites.</p>

<p>The day had broken over half the firmament; the rifles
of the traders were levelled from behind the baggage,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>
and glistened faintly; a crack&mdash;a whoop&mdash;a shout&mdash;a
rout! The scalp of one of the peepers over the ledge
had been bored by the whistling lead from one of
the rifles&mdash;the chief warrior had fallen. The Indians
retreated to their camp, and the whites retained their
position, each watching the others movements. The
position of the traders was such as could command the
country within long rifle-shot on all sides; the Indians,
therefore, declined an attack. The number of their foes,
and perhaps some prudential consideration as to having an
advantageous location, prevented the traders from making
an assault. Well would it have been for them had they
continued to be careful. About nine o'clock, the warlike
appearance gave place to signs of peace. Thirty or forty
unarmed Indians, denuded of clothing and of paint, came
towards the {184} camp of the traders, singing and dancing,
and bearing the Sacred Calumet, or Great Pipe of Peace.
A chief bore it who had acted as lieutenant to the warrior
that had been shot. Its red marble bowl, its stem broad
and long, and carved into hieroglyphics of various colours
and significations, and adorned with feathers of beautiful
birds, was soon recognized by the traders, and secured the
bearer and his attendants a reception into their camp. Both
parties seated themselves in a great circle; the pipe was
filled with tobacco and herbs from the venerated medicine
bag; the well-kindled coal was reverently placed upon the
bowl; its sacred stem was then turned towards the heavens,
to invite the Great Spirit to the solemn assembly, and to
implore his aid; it was then turned towards the earth, to
avert the influence of malicious demons; it was then borne
in a horizontal position, till it completed a circle, to call to
their help in the great smoke, the beneficent invisible agents
which live on the earth, in the waters, and the upper air;
the chief took two whiffs, and blew the smoke first towards<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>
heaven, and then round upon the ground; and so did others,
until all had inhaled the smoke&mdash;the breath of Indian {185}
fidelity&mdash;and blown it to the earth and heaven, loaded
with the pious vows that are supposed to mingle with it
while it curls among the lungs near the heart. The chief
then rose and said, in the Spanish language, which the
Eutaws east of the mountains speak well, "that he was
anxious that peace might be restored between the parties;
that himself and people were desirous that the traders
should remain with them; and that if presents were made
to him to the small amount of &pound;140, no objection would
remain to the proposed proceedings of the whites; but on
no account could they enter the Eutaw country without
paying tribute in some form. They were in the Eutaw
country, the tribute was due, they had killed a Eutaw chief,
and the blood of a chief was due; but that the latter could
be compromised by a prompt compliance with his proposition
in regard to the presents."</p>

<p>The chief trader was explicit in his reply. "That he
had come into the country to sell goods, not to give them
away; that no tribute could be paid to him or to any other
Eutaw; and that if fighting were a desideratum with the
chief and his people, he would do his part to make {186} it
sufficiently lively to be interesting." The council broke up
tumultuously. The Indians carried back the wampum
belts to their camp, held war councils, and whipt and
danced around posts painted red, and recounted their
deeds of valour, and showed high in air, as they leaped
in the frenzy of mimic warfare, the store of scalps that
garnished the doors of the family lodges; and around
their camp-fires the following night were seen features
distorted with the most ghastly wrath. Indeed, the savages
appeared resolved to destroy the whites. And as they
were able, by their superior numbers to do so, it was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>
deemed advisable to get beyond their reach, with all practicable
haste.</p>

<p>At midnight, therefore, when the fires had smouldered
low, the traders saddled in silent haste, bound their bales
upon their pack-mules, and departed while the wolves were
howling the hour; and succeeded by the dawn of day in
reaching a gorge where they had expected the Indians (if
they had discovered their departure in season to reach it)
would oppose their retreat. On reconnoitering, however,
it was found clear; and with joy they entered the defile,
and beheld from its eastern opening, the wide cold plains,
and the sun rising, red and cheerful, {187} on the distant
outline of the morning sky. A few days after, they reached
the post&mdash;not a little glad that their flesh was not rotting
with many who had been less successful than themselves,
in escaping death at the hands of the Eutaws. For the
insults, robberies, and murders, committed by this and
other tribes, the traders Bents have sought opportunities to
take well-measured vengeance: and liberally and bravely
have they often dealt it out. But the consequence seems to
have been the exciting of the bitterest enmity between the
parties; which results in a little more inconvenience to the
traders than to the Indians; for the latter, to gratify their
propensity to steal, and their hatred to the former, make an
annual levy upon the cavy-yard of the fortress, which, as
it contains usually from eighty to one hundred horses, mules,
&amp;c., furnishes to the men of the tomahawk a very comfortable
and satisfactory retribution for the inhibition of the
owners of them upon their immemorial right to rob and
murder, in manner and form as prescribed by the customs
of their race.</p>

<p>The business within the walls of the post is done by
clerks and traders. The former of these are more commonly
young gentlemen {188} from the cities of the States;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>
their duty is to keep the books of the establishment. The
traders are generally selected from among those daring
individuals who have traversed the Prairie and Mountain
Wilderness with goods or traps, and understand the best
mode of dealing with the Indians. Their duty is to weigh
sugar, coffee, powder, &amp;c., in a Connecticut pint-cup; and
measure red baize, beads, &amp;c., and speak the several Indian
languages that have a name for beaver skins, buffalo robes,
and money. They are as fine fellows as can anywhere be
found.</p>

<p>Fort William is owned by three brothers, by the name of
Bent, from St. Louis. Two of them were at the post when
we arrived. They seemed to be thoroughly initiated into
Indian life; dressed like chiefs&mdash;in moccasins thoroughly
garnished with beads and porcupine quills; in trousers of
deer skin, with long fringes of the same extending along
the outer seam from the ankle to the hip; in the splendid
hunting-shirt of the same material, with sleeves fringed on
the elbow seam from the wrist to the shoulder, and ornamented
with figures of porcupine quills of various colours,
and leathern fringe around the lower edge of the body.
And {189} chiefs they were in the authority exercised in
their wild and lonely fortress.</p>

<p>A trading establishment to be known must be seen. A
solitary abode of men, seeking wealth in the teeth of danger
and hardship, rearing its towers over the uncultivated wastes
of nature, like an old baronial castle that has withstood the
wars and desolations of centuries; Indian women tripping
around its battlements in their glittering moccasins and
long deer skin wrappers; their children, with most perfect
forms, and the carnation of the Saxon cheek struggling
through the shading of the Indian, and chattering now
Indian, and now Spanish or English; the grave owners and
their clerks and traders, seated in the shade of the piazza,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>
smoking the long native pipe, passing it from one to another,
drawing the precious smoke into the lungs by short hysterical
sucks till filled, and then ejecting it through the nostrils; or
it may be, seated around their rude table, spread with coffee
or tea, jerked buffalo meat, and bread made of unbolted
wheaten meal from Taos; or, after eating, laid comfortably
upon their pallets of straw and Spanish blankets, and dreaming
to the sweet notes of a flute; the old trappers withered
with {190} exposure to the rending elements, the half-tamed
Indian, and half civilized Mexican servants, seated on the
ground around a large tin pan of dry meat, and a tankard
of water, their only rations, relating adventures about the
shores of Hudson's Bay, on the rivers Columbia and Mackenzie,
in the Great Prairie Wilderness, and among the
snowy heights of the mountains; and delivering sage opinions
about the destination of certain bands of buffalo; of the
distance to the Blackfoot country, and whether my wounded
man was hurt as badly as Bill the mule was, when the
"meal party" was fired upon by the Cumanches&mdash;present
a tolerable idea of every thing within its walls.</p>

<p>If we add, the opening of the gates on a winter's morning&mdash;the
cautious sliding in and out of the Indians whose
tents stand around the fort, till the whole area is filled six
feet deep with their long hanging black locks, and dark
watchful flashing eyes; and traders and clerks busy at their
work; and the patrols walking the battlements with loaded
muskets; and the guards in the bastions standing with
burning matches by the carronades; and when the sun
sets, the Indians retiring again to their camp outside, to
talk over their newly purchased blankets {191} and beads,
and to sing and drink and dance; and the night sentinel on
the fort that treads his weary watch away; we shall present
a tolerable view of this post in the season of business.</p>

<p>It was summer time with man and beast when I was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>
there. The fine days spent in the enjoyment of its hospitalities
were of great service to ourselves, and in recruiting
our jaded animals. The man, too, who had been wounded
on the Santa F&eacute; trade, recovered astonishingly.</p>

<p>The mutineers, on the 11th of July, started for Bent's
Fort, on the Platte;<a name="FNanchor_112" id="FNanchor_112"></a><a href="#Footnote_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a> and myself, with three sound and
good men, and one wounded and bad one, strode our animals
and took trail again for the mountains and Oregon
Territory. Five miles above Fort William, we came to
Fort El Puebla. It is constructed of adobies, and consists
of a series of one-story houses built around a quadrangle,
in the general style of those at Fort William. It belongs
to a company of American and Mexican trappers, who,
wearied with the service, have retired to this spot to spend
the remainder of their days in raising grain, vegetables,
horses, mules, &amp;c., for the various {192} trading establishments
in these regions. And as the Arkansas, some four
miles above the post, can be turned from its course over
large tracts of rich land, these individuals might realize the
happiest results from their industry;&mdash;for, as it is impossible,
from the looseness of the soil and the scarcity of rain,
to raise any thing thereabout without irrigation; and, as
this is the only spot, for a long distance up and down the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>Arkansas, where any considerable tracts of land can be
watered, they could supply the market with these articles
without any fear of competition.<a name="FNanchor_113" id="FNanchor_113"></a><a href="#Footnote_113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a></p>

<p>But these, like the results of many honest intentions, are
wholly crippled by want of capital and a superabundance
of whisky. The proprietors are poor, and when the keg
is on tap, dream away their existence under its dangerous
fascinations. Hence it is that these men, destitute of the
means to carry out their designs in regard to farming, have
found themselves not wholly unemployed in drunkenness;
a substitute which many other individuals have before been
known to prefer. They have, however, a small stock; consisting
of horses and mules, cattle, sheep, and goats; and
still maintain their original intention of irrigating and cultivating
{193} the land in the vicinity of their establishment.</p>

<p>We arrived here about four o'clock in the afternoon; and,
being desirous of purchasing a horse for one of the men,
and making some farther arrangements for my journey, I
determined to stop for the night. At this place I found a
number of independent trappers, who after the spring-hunt
had come down from the mountains, taken rooms free of rent,
stored their fur, and opened a trade for whisky. One skin,
valued at four dollars, buys in that market one pint of
whisky; no more, no less. Unless, indeed, some theorists
in the vanity of their dogmas, may consider it less, when
plentifully mollified with water; a process that increases
in value, as the faucet falters in the energy of its action;
for the seller knows, that if the pure liquid should so
mollify the whisky, as to delay the hopes of merriment
too long, another beaver-skin will be taken from the jolly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>
trapper's pack, and another quantity of the joyful mixture
obtained. Thus matters will proceed, until the stores of
furs, the hardships of the hunt, the toils and exposures of
trapping, the icy streams of the wilderness, the bloody fight,
foot to foot, with the knife and tomahawk, {194} and the
long days and nights of thirst and starvation are satisfactorily
cancelled in the dreamy felicity which whisky, rum,
gin, brandy and ipecacuanha, if properly administered, are
accustomed to produce.</p>

<p>One of these trappers was from New Hampshire; he had
been educated at Dartmouth College, and was altogether
one of the most remarkable men I ever knew. A splendid
gentleman, a finished scholar, a critic on English and Roman
literature, a politician, a trapper, an Indian! His
stature was something more than six feet; his shoulders
and chest were broad, and his arms and lower limbs well
formed, and very muscular. His forehead was high and
expansive; Causality, Comparison, Eventuality, and all
the perceptive organs, (to use a phrenological description),
remarkably large. Locality was, however, larger than any
other organ in the frontal region. Benevolence, Wonder,
Ideality, Secretiveness, Destructiveness, and Adhesiveness,
Combativeness, Self-Esteem and Hope were very high.
The remaining organs were low. His head was clothed
with hair as black as jet, two and a half feet in length,
smoothly combed, and hanging down his back. He {195}
was dressed in a deer-skin frock, leggings and moccasins;
not a shred of cloth about his person. On my first interview
with him, he addressed me with the stiff, cold formality
of one conscious of his own importance; and, in a manner
that he thought unobserved, scrutinized the movement of
every muscle of my face, and every word which I uttered.
When any thing was said of political events in the States or
Europe, he gave silent and intense attention.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span></p>

<p>I left him without any very good impressions of his character;
for I had induced him to open his compressed mouth
but once, and then to make the no very agreeable inquiries,
"When do you start?" and "What route do you take?"
At my second interview, he was more familiar. Having
ascertained that he was proud of his learning, I approached
him through that medium. He seemed pleased at this compliment
to his superiority over those around him, and at
once became easy and talkative. His "Alma Mater" was
described and redescribed; all the fields, and walks, and
rivulets, the beautiful Connecticut, the evergreen primitive
ridges lying along its banks, which, he said, "had
smiled for a thousand ages on the march of decay;" were
successive {196} themes of his vast imagination. His descriptions
were minute and exquisite. He saw in every thing all
that Science sees, together with all that his capacious intellect,
instructed and imbued with the wild fancyings and
legends of his race, could see. I inquired the reason of his
leaving civilized life for a precarious livelihood in the wilderness.
"For reasons found in the nature of my race," he
replied. "The Indian's eye cannot be satisfied with a
description of things, how beautiful soever may be the style,
or the harmonies of verse in which it is conveyed. For
neither the periods of burning eloquence, nor the mighty
and beautiful creations of the imagination, can unbosom
the treasures and realities as they live in their own native
magnificence on the eternal mountains, and in the secret,
untrodden vale.</p>

<p>"As soon as you thrust the ploughshare under the earth,
it teems with worms and useless weeds. It increases population
to an unnatural extent; creates the necessity of penal
enactments, builds the jail, erects the gallows, spreads over
the human face a mask of deception and selfishness, and
substitutes villany, love of wealth and power, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>
slaughter of millions for the gratification {197} of some
individual instead of the single-minded honesty, the hospitality,
the honour and the purity of the natural state.
Hence, wherever Agriculture appears, the increase of
moral and physical wretchedness induces the thousands
of necessities, as they are termed, for abridging human
liberty; for fettering down the mind to the principles of
right, derived, not from nature, but from a restrained
and forced condition of existence. And hence my race,
with mental and physical habits as free as the waters which
flow from the hills, become restive under the rules of civilized
life; dwindle to their graves under the control of laws,
customs, and forms, which have grown out of the endless
vices, and the factitious virtue of another race. Red men
often acquire and love the Sciences. But with the nature
which the Great Spirit has given them, what are all their
truths to them? Would an Indian ever measure the height
of a mountain that he could climb? No, never. The
legends of his tribe tell him nothing about quadrants, and
base lines and angles. Their old braves, however, have
for ages watched from the cliffs, the green life in the spring,
and the yellow death in the autumn, of their holy forests.
Why should he ever calculate an eclipse? He {198} always
knew such occurrences to be the doings of the Great Spirit.</p>

<p>"Science, it is true, can tell the times and seasons of their
coming; but the Indian, when they do occur, looks through
nature, without the aid of science, up to its cause. Of
what use is a Lunar to him? His swift canoe has the green
embowered shores, and well-known headlands, to guide its
course. In fine, what are the arts of peace, of war, of agriculture,
or any thing civilized, to him? His nature and its
elements, like the pine which shadows its wigwam, are too
mighty, too grand, of too strong a fibre, to form a stock on
which to engraft the rose or the violet of polished life. No.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>
I must range the hills, I must always be able to out-travel
my horses, I must always be able to strip my own wardrobe
from the backs of the deer and buffalo, and to feed upon
their rich loins; I must always be able to punish my enemy
with my own hand, or I am no longer an Indian. And if
I am any thing else, I am a mere imitation of an ape."</p>

<p>The enthusiasm with which these sentiments were uttered
impressed me with an awe I had never previously felt for
the unborrowed dignity and independence of the genuine,
original character {199} of the American Indians. Enfeebled,
and reduced to a state of dependence by disease
and the crowding hosts of civilized men, we find among
them still, too much of their own, to adopt the character
of another race, too much bravery to feel like a conquered
people, and a preference of annihilation to the abandonment
of that course of life, consecrated by a thousand generations
of venerated ancestors.</p>

<p>This Indian has been trapping among the Rocky Mountains
for seventeen years. During that time, he has been
often employed as an express to carry news from one trading
post to another, and from the mountains to Missouri.
In these journeys he has been remarkable for the directness
of his courses, and the exceedingly short space of time
required to accomplish them. Mountains which neither
Indian nor white man dared attempt to scale, if opposing
his right-line track, he has crossed. Angry streams, heavy
and cold from the snows, and plunging and roaring among
the girding caverns of the hills, he has swum; he has met
the tempest as it groaned over the plains, and hung upon the
trembling towers of the everlasting hills; and without a
horse, or even a dog, traversed often the terrible and boundless
wastes of mountains, {200} and plains, and desert valleys,
through which I am travelling; and the ruder the blast,
the larger the bolts, and the louder the peals of the dread<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>ful
tempest, when the earth and the sky seem joined by a
moving cataract of flood and flame driven by the wind, the
more was it like himself, a free, unmarred manifestation of
the sublime energies of nature. He says that he never
intends again to visit the States, or any other part of the
earth "which has been torn and spoiled by the slaves of
agriculture." "I shall live," said he, "and die in the wilderness."
And assuredly he should thus live and die. The
music of the rushing waters should be his requiem, and the
Great Wilderness his tomb.</p>

<p>Another of these peculiar men was an Iroquois from
Canada; a stout, old man, with a flat nose, broad face,
small twinkling black eyes, a swarthy, dirty complexion, a
mouth that laughed from ear to ear. He was always relating
some wonderful tale of a trapper's life, and was particularly
fond of describing his escapes from the Sioux and Blackfeet,
while in the service of the Hudson's Bay Company. On
one occasion he had separated from his fellow-trappers and
travelled far up the Missouri {201} into a particularly beautiful
valley. It was the very spot he had sought in all his
wanderings, as a retreat for himself and his squaw to live
in till they should die. It appeared to him like the gateway
to the Isles of the Blest. The lower mountains were
covered with tall pines, and above and around, except in
the east, where the morning sun sent in his rays, the bright
glittering ridges rose high against the sky, decked in the
garniture of perpetual frosts. Along the valley lay a clear,
pure lake, in the centre of which played a number of fountains,
that threw their waters many feet above its surface,
and sending tiny waves rippling away to the pebbly shores,
made the mountains and groves that were reflected from
its rich bosom seem to leap and clap their hands for joy,
at the sacred quiet that reigned among them.</p>

<p>The old Indian pitched his skin tent on the shore, in a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>
little copse of hemlock, and set his traps. Having done
this, he explored carefully every part of the neighbouring
mountains for ingress and egress, "signs," &amp;c. His object
in this was to ascertain if the valley were frequented by
human beings; and if there were places of escape, should
it be entered by hostile persons {202} through the pass that
led himself to it. He found no other pass, except one for
the waters of the lake through a deep chasm of the mountain;
and this was such that no one could descend it alive
to the lower valleys. For as he waded and swam by turns
down its still waters, he soon found himself drawn by an
increasing current, which sufficiently indicated to him the
cause of the deep roar that resounded from the caverns
beyond. He accordingly made the shore, and climbed
along among the projecting rocks till he overlooked an abyss
of fallen rocks, into which the stream poured and foamed
and was lost in the mist. He returned to his camp satisfied.
He had found an undiscovered valley, stored with beaver
and trout, and grass for his horses, where he could trap and
fish and dream awhile in safety. And every morning, for
three delightful weeks, did he draw the beaver from the
deep pools into which they had plunged when the quick
trap had seized them, and stringing them two and two
together over his pack-horse, bore them to his camp; and
with his long side-knife stripped off the skins of fur, pinned
them to the ground to dry, and in his camp kettle cooked
the much-prized tails for his mid-day {203} repast. "Was
it not a fine hunt that?" asked he; "beaver as thick as
musquitoes, trout as plenty as water. But the ungodly
Blackfeet!" The sun had thrown a few bright rays upon
the rim of the eastern firmament, when the Blackfeet war-whoop
rang around his tent&mdash;a direful "whoop-ah-hooh,"
ending with a yell, piercing harsh and shrill, through the
clenched teeth. He had but one means of escape&mdash;the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>
lake. Into it he plunged, beneath a shower of poisoned
arrows&mdash;plunged deeply&mdash;and swam under while he could
endure the absence of air; he rose, he was in the midst
of his foes swimming and shouting around him; down again,
up to breathe, and on he swam with long and powerful
sweeps. The pursuit was long, but at last our man entered
the chasm he had explored, plunged along the cascade as
near as he dared, clung to a shrub that grew from the
crevice of the rock, and lay under water for the approach
of his pursuers. On they came, they passed, they shrieked
and plunged for ever into the abyss of mist.</p>

<p>Another individual of these veteran trappers was my
guide, Kelly, a blacksmith by trade, from Kentucky. He
left his native State about twelve years ago, and entered
{204} the service of the American Fur Company. Since
that time, he has been in the States but once, and that for
a few weeks only. In his opinion, every thing was so
dull and tiresome that he was compelled to fly to the mountains
again. The food, too, had well nigh killed him:
"The villanous pies and cake, bacon and beef, and the
nicknacks that one is obliged to eat among cousins, would
destroy the constitution of an ostrich." And if he could
eat such stuff, he said he had been so long away from
civilization that he could never again enjoy it. As long
as he could get good buffalo cows to eat, the fine water
of the snowy hills to drink, and good buckskins to wear,
he was satisfied. The mountaineers were free; he could go
and come when he chose, with only his own will for law.</p>

<p>My intercourse with him, however, led me afterwards
to assign another cause for his abandonment of home.
There were times when we were encamped at night on the
cold mountains about a blazing fire, that he related anecdotes
of his younger days with an intensity of feeling which
discovered that a deep fountain of emotion was still open<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>
in his bosom, never to be sealed till he slumber under the
sands of the desert.</p>

<p>{205} We passed the night of the 11th of July at the
Puebla. One of my companions who had, previously to
the division of my company, used horses belonging to an
individual who left us for Santa F&eacute;, and the excellent Mr.
Blair, were without riding animals. It became, therefore, an
object for them to purchase here; and the more so, as there
would be no other opportunity to do so for some hundreds
of miles. But these individuals had no money nor goods
that the owners of the horses would receive in exchange.
They wanted clothing or cash, and as I had a surplus quantity
of linen, I began to bargain for one of the animals.
The first price charged was enormous. A little bantering,
however, brought the owner to his proper senses; and the
articles of payment were overhauled. In doing this, my
whole wardrobe was exposed, and the vendor of horses
became extremely enamoured of my dress-coat, the only one
remaining, not out at the elbows. This he determined to
have. I assured him it was impossible for me to part with
it; the only one I possessed. But he, with quite as much
coolness, assured me that it would then be impossible for
him to part with his horse. These two {206} impossibilities
having met, all prospects of a trade were suspended, till one
or the other of them should yield. After a little, the idea
of walking cast such evident dissatisfaction over the countenances
of my friends, that the coat was yielded, and then
the pants and overcoat, and all my shirts save four, and
various other articles to the value of three such animals in
the States. The horse was then transferred to our keeping.
And such a horse! The biography of her mischief, would
fill a volume! and that of the vexations arising therefrom
to us poor mortals? Would it not fill two volumes of
"Pencillings by the Way," whose only deficiency would be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>
the want of a love incident? Another horse was still necessary;
but in this, as in the other case, a coat was a "sine
qu&acirc; non;" and there being no other article of the kind to
dispose of among us, no bargain could be made. The
night came on amidst these our little preparations. The
owners of the horses and mules belonging to El Puebla,
drove their animals into the court or quadrangle, around
which their houses were built. We gathered our goods and
chattels into a pile, in a corner of the most comfortable
room we could obtain, and so {207} arranged our blankets
and bodies, that it would be difficult for any one to make
depredations upon them during the night, without awaking
us. After conversing with my Dartmouth friend concerning
the mountainous country through which we were to
travel, and the incidents of feasting and battle which had
befallen him during his trapping excursions, we retired to
our couches.</p>

<p>At eight o'clock on the 12th, we were harnessed and on
route again for the mountains. It was a fine mellow morning.
The snowy peaks of the Wolfano mountains, one hundred
and seventy miles to the south-west, rose high and
clear in view.<a name="FNanchor_114" id="FNanchor_114"></a><a href="#Footnote_114" class="fnanchor">[114]</a> The atmosphere was bland like that of
the Indian summer in New England. Five miles' travel
brought us to the encampment of Kelly's servant, who had
been sent abroad the night before to find grass for his horses.
Here another horse was purchased of a Mexican, who had
followed us from Puebla. But on adjusting our baggage,
it appeared that three animals were required for transporting
it over the broken country which lay before us. Messrs.
Blair and Wood would, therefore, still have but a single
saddle horse for their joint use. {208} This was felt to be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>a great misfortune, both on account of the hardships of
such a journey on foot, as well as the delay it would necessarily
cause in the prosecution of it. But these men felt
no such obstacle to be insurmountable, and declared, that
while the plain and the mountains were before them, and
they could walk, they would conquer every difficulty that
lay between them and Oregon. After we had eaten, Kelly's
horses were rigged, and we moved on four or five miles up
the river, where we halted for the night. Our provisions
consisted of a small quantity of wheat meal, a little salt and
pepper, and a few pounds of sugar and coffee. For meat we
depended on our rifles. But as no game appeared during
the day, we spent the evening in attempting to take cat-fish
from the Arkansas. One weighing a pound, after much
practical angling, was caught&mdash;a small consolation surely
to the keen appetites of seven men! But this, and porridge
made of wheat meal and water, constituted our supper
that night and breakfast next morning.</p>

<p>July 13th, fifteen miles along the banks of the Arkansas;
the soil composed of sand slightly intermixed with clay, too
loose to {209} retain moisture, and too little impregnated
with the nutritive salts to produce any thing save a spare
and stinted growth of bunch grass and sun-flowers. Occasional
bluffs of sand and limestone bordered the valley
of the stream. In the afternoon, the range of low mountains
that lie at the eastern base of the Great Cordilleras and
Long's ranges became visible; and even these, though
pigmies in the mountain race, were, in midsummer, partially
covered with snow. Pike's peak in the south-west,
and James' peak in the north-west, at sunset showed
their hoary heads above the clouds which hung around
them.<a name="FNanchor_115" id="FNanchor_115"></a><a href="#Footnote_115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span></p>

<p>On the 14th, made twenty miles. Kelly relieved his
servant by surrendering to him his riding horse for short
distances; and others relieved Blair and Wood in a similar
manner. The face of the plain became more broken as
we approached the mountains. The waters descending
from the lower hills, have cut what was once a plain into
isolated bluffs three or four hundred feet in height, surmounted
and surrounded with columnar and pyramidal
rocks. In the distance they resemble immense fortresses,
with towers and bastions as skilfully arranged as they could
have been by the best suggestions of {210} art&mdash;embattlements
raised by the commotions of warring elements&mdash;by
the storms that have gathered and marshalled their armies
on the heights in view, and poured their desolating power
over these devoted plains!</p>

<p>The Arkansas, since we left Fort William, had preserved
a medium width of a quarter of a mile, the waters still turbid;
its general course east south-east; soil on either side
as far as the eye could reach, light sand and clayey loam,
almost destitute of vegetation.</p>

<p>On the 15th travelled about eighteen miles over a soil so
light that our animals sunk over their fetlocks at every
step. During the forenoon we kept along the bottom
lands of the river. An occasional willow or cotton-wood
tree, ragged and grey with age, or a willow bush trembling,
it almost seemed, at the tale of desolation that
the winds told in passing, were the only relieving features
of the general dearth. The usual colour of the soil
was a greyish blue. At twelve o'clock we stopped on a
plat of low ground which the waters of the river moistened
by filtration through the sand, and baited our horses. Here
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>were forty or fifty decrepid old willows, so poor and shrivelled
that one felt, after enjoying {211} their shade in the heat of
that sultry day, like bestowing alms upon them. At twelve
o'clock we mounted and struck out across the plain to avoid
a southward bend in the river of twenty miles in length.
Near the centre of this bend in the mouth of the river Fontequebouir,
which the trappers who have traversed it for
beaver say, rises in James' Peak eighty miles to the north-west
by north.<a name="FNanchor_116" id="FNanchor_116"></a><a href="#Footnote_116" class="fnanchor">[116]</a></p>

<p>We came upon the banks of this stream at sunset. Kelly
had informed us that we might expect to find deer in the
groves which border its banks. And, like a true hunter, as
soon as we halted at the place of encampment, he sought
them before they should hear or scent us. He traversed
the groves, however, in vain. The beautiful innocents had,
as it afterwards appeared, been lately hunted by a party of
Delaware trappers and in consideration of the ill usage
received from these gentlemen in red, had forsaken their old
retreat for a less desirable but safer one among the distant
hills in the north. So that our expectations of game and
meat subsided in a supper of 'tole'&mdash;plain water porridge.
As our appetites were keen, we all relished it well, except
the Mexican {212} servant, who declared upon his veracity
that 'tole was no bueno.' Our guide was, if possible, as
happy at our evening fire as some one else was when he
"shouldered his crutch and told how fields were won;" and
very much for the same reasons. For, during the afternoon's
tramp, much of his old hunting ground had loomed
in sight. Pike's and James' peaks showed their bald, cold,
shining heads as the sun set; and the mountains on each
side of the upper river began to show the irregularities of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>
their surfaces. So that as we rode along gazing at these
stupendous piles of rocks and earth and ice, he would often
direct his attention to the outlines of chasms, faintly traced
on the shadings of the cliffs, through which various streams
on which he had trapped, tumbled into the plains. I was
particularly interested by his account of Rio Wolfano, a
branch of the Arkansas on the Mexican side, the mouth of
which is twelve miles below that of the Fontequebouir. It
has two principal branches. The one originates in Pike's
peak, seventy or eighty miles in the south; the other rises
far in the west among the Eutaw mountains, and has a
course of about two hundred miles, nearly parallel with the
Arkansas.<a name="FNanchor_117" id="FNanchor_117"></a><a href="#Footnote_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a></p>

<p>{213} We travelled twenty-eight miles on the 16th over
broken barren hills sparsely covered with shrub cedars and
pines. The foliage of these trees is a very dark green.
They cover, more or less, all the low hills that lie along the
roots of the mountains from the Arkansas north to the Missouri.
Hence the name "Black Hills" is given to that portion
of them which lie between the Sweetwater and the
mouth of the Little Missouri. The soil of our track to-day
was a grey barren loam, gravel knolls and bluffs of sand
and limestone.</p>

<p>About four o'clock, <span class="smcap">P. M.</span>, we met an unheard of annoyance.
We were crossing a small plain of red sand, gazing at the
mountains as they opened their outlines of rock and snow,
when, in an instant, we were enveloped in a cloud of flying
ants with greyish wings and dark bodies. They fixed upon
our horses' heads, necks, and shoulders, in such numbers
as to cover them as bees do the sides of a hive when about
to swarm. They flew around our own heads too, and covered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>
our hats and faces. Our eyes seemed special objects
of their attention. We tried to wipe them off; but while the
hand was passing from one side of the face to the other, the
part that was left bare was {214} instantly covered as thickly
as before with these creeping, hovering, nauseous insects.
Our animals were so much annoyed by their pertinacity,
that they stopped in their tracks; and finding it impossible
to urge them along, guide them and keep our faces clear
of the insects at the same time, we dismounted and led
them. Having by this means the free use of our hands and
feet, we were able in the course of half an hour to pass the
infested sands, and once more see and breathe.</p>

<p>We dined at the mouth of Kelly's Creek, another stream
that has its source in James' peak. Encamped at the mouth
of Oakley's creek, another branch of the Arkansas.<a name="FNanchor_118" id="FNanchor_118"></a><a href="#Footnote_118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a> It
rises in the hills which lie thirty-five miles to the north.
It is a clear, cool little brook, with a pebbly bottom, and
banks clothed with shrub cedars and pines. We had a
pleasant evening here, a cloudless sky, a cold breeze from
the snow-clad mountains, a blazing cedar-wood fire, a song
from our merry Joe, a dish of 'tole' and a fine couch of
sand. Who wants more comforts than we enjoyed? My
debilitated system had begun to thrive under the bracing
influence of the mountain air; my companions were well
and happy; our {215} horses and mules were grazing upon
a plat of rich grass; we were almost within touch of those
stupendous ridges of rock and snow which stay or send
forth the tempest in its course, and gather in their rugged
embrace the noblest rivers of the world.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span></p>

<p>July 17. We made twenty miles to-day among the deep
gullies and natural fortresses of this great gateway to the
mountains. All around gave evidence that the agents of
nature have struggled here in their mightiest wrath, not the
volcano, but the floods of ages. Ravines hundreds of feet
in depth; vast insular mounds of earth towering in all
directions, sometimes surmounted by fragments of mountains,
at others, with stratified rocks, the whole range of
vision was a flowerless, bladeless desolation! Our encampment
for the night was at the mouth of Wood's creek, five
miles from the debouchure of the Arkansas from the mountains.<a name="FNanchor_119" id="FNanchor_119"></a><a href="#Footnote_119" class="fnanchor">[119]</a>
The ridges on the south of the river, as viewed
from this place, presented an embankment of congregated
hills, piled one above another to the region of snow, and
scored into deep and irregular chasms, frowning precipices,
tottering rocks, and black glistening strata, whose recent
fractures indicated that they were continually {216} sending
upon the humble hills below weighty testimony of their
own superior height and might. Nothing could be more
perfectly wild. The summits were capped with ice. The
ravines which radiated from their apices were filled with
snow far down their course; and so utterly rough was the
whole mass, that there did not appear to be a foot of plain
surface upon it. Eternal, sublime confusion!</p>

<p>This range runs down the Arkansas, bearing a little
south of a parallel with it, the distance of about fifty miles,
and then turning southward, bears off to Taos and Santa
F&eacute;. At the back of this ridge to the westward, and connected
with it, is said to be a very extensive tract of mountains
which embrace the sources of the Rio Bravo del Norte,
the Wolfano, and other branches of the Arkansas; and a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>
number of streams that fall into Rio Colorado of the West,
and the Gulf of California.<a name="FNanchor_120" id="FNanchor_120"></a><a href="#Footnote_120" class="fnanchor">[120]</a> Among these heights live
the East and West bands of the Eutaws. The valleys in
which they reside are said to be overlooked by mountains
of shining glaciers, and in every other respect to resemble
the valleys of Switzerland. They are a brave, treacherous
race, and said to number about eight thousand souls. They
{217} raise mules, horses, and sheep, and cultivate corn and
beans, trap the beaver, manufacture woollen blankets with
a darning-needle, and intermarry with the Mexican Spaniards.</p>

<p>Sixty miles east of these mountains, and fifty south of
the Arkansas, stands (isolated on the plain), Pike's Peak,
and the lesser ones that cluster around it.<a name="FNanchor_121" id="FNanchor_121"></a><a href="#Footnote_121" class="fnanchor">[121]</a> This Peak is
covered with perpetual snow and ice down one-third its
height. The subordinate peaks rise near to the line of perpetual
congelation, and stand out upon the sky like giant
watchmen, as if to protect the vestal snows above them
from the polluting tread of man. On the north side of
the river a range of mountains, or hills, as they have been
called by those who are in the habit of looking on the Great
Main Ridges, rise about two thousand feet above the plain.
They resemble, in their general characteristics, those on the
south. Like them, they are dark and broken; like them,
sparsely covered on their sides with shrub pines and cedars.
They diverge also from the river as they descend: and
after descending it forty miles, turn to the north, and lose
themselves in the heights which congregate around James'
Peak.</p>

<p>{218} On the morning of the 18th we rose early, made
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>our simple repast of tole, and prepared to enter the mountains.
A joyful occasion this. The storms, the mud, the
swollen streams, the bleakness and barrenness of the Great
Prairie Wilderness, in an hour's ride, would be behind us;
and the deep, rich vales, the cool streams and breezes, and
transparent atmosphere of the more elevated regions, were
to be entered.</p>

<p>Wood's Creek, on which we had passed the night, is a
cold, heavy torrent, from the northern hills. At the ford,
it was about three feet deep, and seven yards wide. But
the current was so strong as to bear away two of our saddle-horses.
One of these was my Puebla animal. She entered
the stream with all the caution necessary for the result.
Stepping alternately back, forward, and sidewise, and
examining the effect of every rolling stone upon the laws
of her own gravity, she finally gathered her ugly form upon
one of sufficient size and mobility to plunge herself and
rider into the stream. She floated down a few yards, and,
contrary to my most fervent desire, came upon her feet
again, and made the land. By dint of wading, and partially
drowning, and other like agreeable ablutions, we found
ourselves at {219} last on the right side of the water: and
having bestowed upon it sundry commendatory epithets of
long and approved use under like circumstances, we remounted;
and shivering in the freezing winds from the
neighbouring snows, trotted on at a pace so merry and fast,
that three-quarters of an hour brought us to the buttress of
the cliffs, where the Arkansas leaps foaming from them.</p>

<p>This river runs two hundred miles among the mountains.
The first half of the distance is among a series of charming
valleys, stocked with an endless number of deer and elk,
which, in the summer, live upon the nutritious wild grass of
the vales, and in the winter, upon the buds, twigs, and bark
of trees. The hundred miles of its course next below, is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>
among perpendicular cliffs rising on both sides hundreds,
and sometimes thousands, of feet in height. Through this
dismal channel, with a rapid current down lofty precipices,
and through compressed passes, it plunges and roars to
this point, where it escapes nobly and gleefully, as if glad at
having fled some fearful edict of nature, consigning it to
perpetual imprisonment in those dismal caverns.<a name="FNanchor_122" id="FNanchor_122"></a><a href="#Footnote_122" class="fnanchor">[122]</a></p>

<p>Here we entered the Rocky Mountains {220} through a
deep gorge at the right, formed by the waters of a little
brook which comes down from the north.<a name="FNanchor_123" id="FNanchor_123"></a><a href="#Footnote_123" class="fnanchor">[123]</a> It is a sweet
stream. It babbles so delightfully upon the ear, like those
that flowed by one's home, when youth was dreaming of
the hopes of coming years in the shade of the hemlock by
the family spring. On its banks grew the dandelion, the
angelica, the elder, the alder and birch, and the mountain-flax.
The pebbles, too, seemed old acquaintances, they were
so like those which I had often gathered, with a lovely sister
long since dead, who would teach me to select the prettiest
and best. The very mountains were dark and mighty, and
overhanging, and striped with the departing snows, like
those that I viewed in the first years of remembrance, as I
frolicked with my brothers on the mossy rocks.</p>

<p>We soon lost sight of the Arkansas among the small pines
and cedars of the valley, and this we were sorry to do. The
good old stream had given us many a fine cat-fish, and many
a bumper of delicious water while we travelled wearily
along its parched banks. It was like parting with an old
companion that had ministered to our wants, and stood
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>with us in anxious, dangerous times. It was, therefore,
pleasant to hear its voice come {221} up from the caverns like
a sacred farewell while we wound our way up the valley.</p>

<p>This gorge, or valley, runs about ten miles in a northwardly
direction from the debouchure of the Arkansas, to
the dividing ridge between the waters of that river and those of
the southern head-waters of the south fork of the Great Platte.</p>

<p>About midway its length, the trail, or Indian track, divides:
the one branch makes a circuit among the heights to the
westward, terminates in the great valley of the south fork of
the Platte, within the mountains, commonly called "Boyou
Salade;" and the other and shorter leads northwardly
up the gorge to the same point.<a name="FNanchor_124" id="FNanchor_124"></a><a href="#Footnote_124" class="fnanchor">[124]</a> Our guide carefully
examined both trails at the diverging point, and finding
the more western one most travelled, and believing, for
this reason, the eastward one the least likely to be occupied
by the Indians, he led us up to the foot of the mountain
which separates it from the vales beyond. We arrived at
a little open spot at the base of the height about twelve
o'clock. The steepest part of the trail up the declivity was
a loose, moving surface of sand and pebbles, constantly
falling under its own weight. Other portions were precipitous,
lying along overhanging {222} cliffs and the
brinks of deep ravines strewn with fallen rocks. To
ascend it seemed impossible; but our old Kentuckian
was of a different opinion.</p>

<p>In his hunting expeditions he had often ascended and
descended worse steeps with packs of beaver, traps, &amp;c.
So, after a description of others of a much more difficult
nature, which he had made with worse animals and heavier<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span>
packs, through storms of hail and heaps of snow; and after
the assurance that the Eutaw village of tents, and women,
and children, had passed this not many moons ago, we
felt nettled at our own ignorance of possibilities in these
regions, and drove off to the task. Our worthy guide led
the way with his saddle-horse following him; the pack
animals, each under the encouraging guardianship of a
vigorous goad, and the men and myself leading our riding
animals, brought up the rear. Now for a long pull, a
strong pull, and a pull not all together, but each leg on its
own account. Five or six rods of zigzag clambering, and
slipping, and gathering, and tugging, advanced us one
on the ascent; and then a halt for breath and strength for
a new effort. The puffing and blowing over, a general
shout, "go on, go on," started the cavalcade {223} again.
The pack animals, with each one hundred and fifty pounds
weight, struggled and floundered, as step after step gave
way in the sliding sand; but they laboured madly, and
advanced at intervals of a few yards, resting and then on
again, till they arrived at the rocky surface, about midway
the ascent. Here a short pause upon the declivity was
interrupted by a call of "onward" from our guide; and
again we climbed. The track wound around a beetling
cliff, which crowded the animals upon the edge of a frightful
precipice. In the most dangerous part of it, my Puebla
mare ran her pack against a projecting rock, and for an
instant reeled over an abyss three hundred feet in depth.
But her fortune favoured her; she blundered away from
her grave, and lived to make a deeper plunge farther along
the journey.</p>

<p>The upper half, though less steep, proved to be the worst
part of the ascent. It was a bed of rocks, at one place
small and rolling, at another large and fixed, with deep openings
between them; so that our animals were constantly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>
falling, and tottering upon the brink of the cliffs, as they
rose again and made their way among them. An hour and
a half of this most dangerous and tiresome {224} clambering
deposited us in a grove of yellow pines, near the summit.
Our animals were covered with sweat and dirt, and trembled
as if at that instant from the race track. Nor were their
masters free from every ill of weariness. Our knees smote
each other with fatigue, as Belshazzar's did with fear.</p>

<p>Many of the pines on this ridge were two feet in diameter,
and a hundred feet high, with small clusters of limbs around
the tops. Others were low, and clothed with strong limbs
quite near the ground. Under a number of these latter, we
had seated ourselves, holding the reins of our riding horses,
when a storm arose with the rapidity of a whirlwind, and
poured upon us hail, rain, and snow with all imaginable
liberality. It was a most remarkable tempest. Unlike
those whose monotonous groans are heard among the Green
Mountains for days before they assemble their fury around
you, it came in its strength at once, and rocked the stately
pines to their most distant roots. Unlike those long "blows,"
which, generated in the frozen zone of the Atlantic seas,
bring down the frosty blasts of Greenland upon the warmer
climes of the States, it was the meeting {225} of different
currents of the a&euml;rial seas, lashed and torn by the live thunder,
among the sounding mountains. One portion of it
had gathered its electricity and mist around James' Peak
in the east; another among the white heights north-west;
and a third among the snowy pyramids of the Eutaws in
the south-west; and, marshalling their hosts, met over
this connecting ridge between the eastern and central ranges,
as if by general battle to settle a vexed question as to the
better right to the Pass; and it was sublimely fought. The
opposing storms met nearly at the zenith, and fiercely rolled
together their angry masses. As if to carry out the simile I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span>
have here attempted, at the moment of their junction, the
electricity of each leaped upon its antagonist transversely
across the heavens, and in some instances fell in immense
bolts upon the trembling cliffs; and then instantly came a
volley of hail as large as grape-shot, sufficient to whiten all
the towers of this horrid war. It lasted an hour. I never
before, not even on the plains, saw such a movement of the
elements. If anything had been wanting to establish the
theory, this exhibition sufficed to convince those who saw its
{226} movements, and felt its power, that these mountains
are the great laboratory of mist, wind, and electricity, which,
formed into storms, are sent in such awful fury upon the
great plains or prairies that stretch away from their bases
to the States, and, that here alone may be witnessed the
extreme power of the warring elements.</p>

<p>After the violence of the tempest had abated, we travelled
up the remainder of the ascent, and halted a few minutes on
the summit to view the scene around us.<a name="FNanchor_125" id="FNanchor_125"></a><a href="#Footnote_125" class="fnanchor">[125]</a> Behind was the
valley up which we had travelled, covered with evergreen
shrubs. On the east of this, rose a precipitous wall of
stratified rock, two thousand or three thousand feet high,
stretching off towards the Arkansas, and dotted here and
there with the small shrub pine, struggling from the crevices
of the rocks. In the south-west the mountains, less precipitous,
rose one above another in a distance, till their blue
tops faded into the semblance of the sky. To the east of
our position, there was nothing in sight but piles of mountains,
whose dark and ragged masses increased in height
and magnitude, till they towered in naked grandeur around
James' Peak. From that frozen height ran off to the north
{227} that secondary range of mountains that lie between
the head-waters of the South Fork of the Platte and the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span>plains. This is a range of brown, barren, and broken
ridges, destitute alike of earth and shrub, with an average
height of three thousand feet above the plain. On the
western side of it, and north of the place where we were
viewing them, hills of a constantly decreasing height fall
off for fifty miles to the north-west, till they sink in the
beautiful valley of Boyou Salade, and then rising again,
tower higher and higher in the west, until lost in the haze
about the base of the Anahuac range; a vast waste of
undusted rocks, without a flower or leaf to adorn it, save
those that hide their sweetness from its eternal winters in
the glens down which we were to travel.</p>

<p>The Anahuac ridge of the snowy range was visible for at
least one hundred miles of latitude; and the nearest point
was so far distant that the dip of the horizon concealed all
that portion of it below the line of perpetual congelation.
The whole mass was purely white. The principal
irregularity perceptible was a slight undulation on the
upper edge. There was, however, perceptible shading
on the lower edge, produced, perhaps, by great lateral
swells protruding {228} from the general outline. But the
mass, at least ninety miles distant, as white as milk, the
home of the frosts of all ages, stretching away to the north
by west full a hundred miles, unscaled by any living thing,
except perhaps by the bold bird of our national arms,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Broad, high, eternal, and sublime,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The mock of ages and the twin of time,"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>is an object of amazing grandeur, unequalled probably on
the face of the globe.</p>

<p>We left this interesting panorama, and travelled down
five miles to the side of a little stream running north, and
encamped.<a name="FNanchor_126" id="FNanchor_126"></a><a href="#Footnote_126" class="fnanchor">[126]</a> We were wet from head to foot, and shivering
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span>with cold. The day had indeed been one of much discomfort;
yet we had been well repaid for all this by the absorbing
freshness and sublimity that hung around us. The
lightning bounding on the crags; the thunder breaking the
slumber of the mountains; a cooler climate, and the noble
pine again; a view of the Great Main snowy range of the
"Rocky," "Stone," or "Shining" mountains, south of the
Great Gap, from a height never before trodden by a civilized
tourist, the sight of the endless assemblage of rocky
peaks, among which {229} our weary feet were yet to tread
along unexplored waters, were the delights which lay upon
the track of the day, and made us happy at our evening
fire. Our supper of water porridge being eaten, we tried
to sleep. But the cold wind from the snow soon drove us
from our blankets to our fire, where we turned ourselves
like Christmas turkeys, till morning. The mountain flax
grew around our encampment. Every stalk was stiffened
by the frosts of the night; and the waters of the brooks were
barred with ice. This is the birth-place of the Plattes.
From these gorges its floods receive existence, among the
sturdy, solemn pines and nursing tempests, twelve miles
north of the Arkansas's debouchement from the mountains,
and forty miles due west from James' Peak.</p>

<p>On the 19th we travelled in a northward course down the
little streams bursting from the hills, and babbling among
the bushes. We were upon an Indian trail, full of sharp
gravel, that annoyed our animals exceedingly. The pines
were often difficult to pass, so thick were they. But the
right course was easily discovered among them, even when
the soil was so hard as to have received no impression from
previous {230} travelling, by small stones which the Eutaws
had placed among the branches. About mid-day we saw
scattering spears of the wild flax again, and a few small
shrubs of the black birch near the water courses. The end<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span>less
climbing and ascending of hills prevented our making
much progress. At two o'clock we judged ourselves but
ten miles from the last night's encampment. A cloud of
hail then beginning to pelt and chill us, we took shelter in a
small grove of pines. But as the hail had fallen two inches
in depth, over the whole adjoining country, every movement
of the atmosphere was like a blast of December. Too
cold to sleep, we therefore built fires and dried our packs,
&amp;c., till the howl of the wolves gave notice of the approach
of morning.</p>

<p>Tole for breakfast. It had been our only food for nine
days. It seemed strange that we should have travelled one
hundred and eighty miles, in a country like that we had
passed through since leaving Fort William, without killing
an animal. But it ceased to appear so, when our worthy
guide informed us that no individual had ever come from
the Arkansas, in the region of the Fort, to the mountains,
with as little suffering as we had. "It is," said he, "a
starving {231} country; never any game found in it. The
buffalo come into these valleys from the north through the
Bull Pen, and go out there when the storms of the autumn
warn them to fly to the south for warm winter quarters.
But that valley off there, (pointing to a low smooth spot
in the horizon), looks mighty like Boyou Salade, my old
stamping ground. If it should be, we will have meat
before the sun is behind the snow."<a name="FNanchor_127" id="FNanchor_127"></a><a href="#Footnote_127" class="fnanchor">[127]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span></p>

<p>We were well pleased with this prospect. Our Mexican
servant cried, at the top of his voice, "Esta muy bueno,
Se&ntilde;or Kelly, si, muy bueno, este Boyou Salade; mucho
carne por nosotros." And the poor fellow had some reasons
for this expression of joy, for the tole regimen had been
to him what the water gruel of the Mudfog workhouse was
to Oliver Twist, except that its excellent flavour had never
induced the Mexican "to ask for more." He had, on previous
occasions, in company with Kelly, gnawed the ribs of
many a fat cow in Boyou Salade; and the instincts of his
stomach put him in such a frenzy at the recollection, that
although he could only understand the words "Boyou
Salade," these were sufficient to induce him to cross {232}
himself from the fore-step to the abdomen, and to swear by
Santa Gaudaloupe that tole was not food for a Christian
mouth.</p>

<p>On the 20th we were early on our way. The small
prairie wolf which had howled us to sleep every evening,
and howled us awake every morning since we left Independence,
was continually greeting us with an ill-natured growl,
as we rode along among his hiding places. The streams
that were mere rivulets twenty miles back, having received
a thousand tributaries, were now heavy and deep torrents.
The peaks and mountain swells were clad with hail and
snow. Every thing, even ourselves, shivering in our blankets,
gave evidence that we were traversing the realms of
winter. Still many of the grasses and flowers which usually
flourish in high latitudes and elevated places were
growing along the radices of the hills, and aided much in
giving the whole scene an unusually singular aspect. We
were in fine spirits, and in the enjoyment of a voracious
appetite. Our expectations of having a shot soon at a
buffalo, were perhaps an accessory cause of this last. But
be that as it may, we dodged along among the pines and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span>
spruce and hemlock and firs {233} about ten miles, and rose
over a swell of land covered with small trees in full view of
a quiet little band of buffalo. Ye deities who presided of
old over the trencher and goblet, did not our palates leap
for a tender loin? A halt&mdash;our famous old Kentuckian
creeps away around a copse of wood&mdash;we hear the crack
of his deadly rifle&mdash;witness the writhing of the buffalo!
He lays himself gently down. All is now silent, intense
anxiety to observe whether he will rise again and run, as
buffalo often do under the smart of a wound, beyond our
reach among the hills. No! he curls his tail as in the last
agony; he choaks; he is ours! he is ours!</p>

<p>Our knives are quickly hauled from their sheaths&mdash;he
is rolled upon his brisket&mdash;his hide is slit along the spine,
and pealed down midrib; one side of it is cut off and spread
upon the sand to receive the meat; the flesh on each side
of the spine is pared off; the mouth is opened, and the
tongue removed from his jaws; the axe is laid to his rib;
the heart&mdash;the fat&mdash;the tender loins&mdash;the blood, are
taken out&mdash;his legs are rifled of their generous marrow
bones; all wrapped in the green hide, and loaded on
animals, and off to camp in a charming {234} grove of
white pine by a cold stream of water under a woody hill!</p>

<p>Who that had seen us stirring our fires that night in the
starlight of bright skies among the mountain forests; who
that had seen the buffalo ribs propped up before the
crackling blaze&mdash;the brisket boiling in our camp-kettles;
who that had seen us with open countenances yield to these
well cooked invitations to "drive dull care away," will not
believe that we accepted them, and swallowed against time,
and hunger, and tole? Indeed, we ate that night till there
was a reasonable presumption that we had eaten enough;
and when we had spent a half-hour in this agreeable employment,
that presumption was supported by a pile of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>
bones, which if put together by Buffon in his best style,
would have supported not only that but another presumption
to the like effect. Our hearty old Kentuckian was at
home, and we were his guests. He sat at the head of his
own board, and claimed to dictate the number of courses
with which we should be served. "No, no," said he, as we
strode away from the bare ribs which lay round us, to our
couches of pine leaves, "no, no, I have eaten with you,
fared well, and now you {235} must take courage while
you eat with me; no, no, not done yet; mighty good eating
to come. Take a rest upon it, if you like, while I cook
another turn; but I'll insure you to eat till day peeps. Our
meat here in the mountains never pains one. Nothing
harms here but pills and lead; many's the time that I have
starved six and eight days, and when I have found meat,
ate all night; that's the custom of the country. We never
borrow trouble from hunger or thirst, and when we have
a plenty, we eat the best pieces first, for fear of being killed
by some brat of an Indian before we have enjoyed them.
You may eat as much as you can; my word for it, this wild
meat never hurts one. But your chickens and bacon, &amp;c.,
in the settlements, it came right near shoving me into the
Kenyon when I was down there last."</p>

<p>While the excellent man was giving vent to these kind
feelings, he was busy making preparations for another
course. The marrow bones were undergoing a severe
flagellation; the blows of the old hunter's hatchet were
cracking them in pieces, and laying bare the rolls of "trapper's
butter" within them. A pound of marrow was {236}
thus extracted, and put into a gallon of water heated nearly
to the boiling point. The blood which he had dipped from
the cavity of the buffalo was then stirred in till the mass
became of the consistency of rice soup. A little salt and
black pepper finished the preparation. It was a fine dish;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span>
too rich, perhaps, for some of my esteemed acquaintances,
whose digestive organs partake of the general laziness of
their habits; but to us who had so long desired a healthful
portion of bodily exercise in that quarter, it was the very
marrow and life-blood of whatsoever is good and wholesome
for famished carnivorous animals like ourselves. It
was excellent, most excellent. It was better than our
father's foaming ale. For while it loosed our tongues and
warmed our hearts towards one another, it had the additional
effect of Aaron's oil; it made our faces to shine with
grease and gladness. But the remembrance of the palate
pleasures of the next course, will not allow me to dwell
longer upon this. The crowning gratification was yet in
store for us.</p>

<p>While enjoying the soup, which I have just described,
we believed the bumper of our pleasures to be sparkling to
the brim; {237} and if our excellent old trapper had not
been there, we never should have desired more. But how
true is that philosophy which teaches, that to be capable of
happiness, we must be conscious of wants! Our friend
Kelly was in this a practical as well as theoretical Epicurean.
"No giving up the beaver so," said he; "another bait and
we will sleep."</p>

<p>Saying this, he seized the intestines of the buffalo, which
had been properly cleaned for the purpose, turned them
inside out, and as he proceeded stuffed them with strips of
well salted and peppered tender loin. Our "<i>boudies</i>"
thus made, were stuck upon sticks before the fire, and
roasted till they were thoroughly cooked and brown. The
sticks were then taken from their roasting position and
stuck in position for eating; that is to say, each of us with
as fine an appetite as ever blessed a New England boy at
his grandsire's Thanksgiving dinner, seized a stick pit,
stuck it in the earth near our couches, and sitting upon our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span>
haunches, ate our last course&mdash;the desert of a mountain
host's entertainment. These wilderness sausages would
have gratified the appetite of {238} those who had been
deprived of meat a less time than we had been. The envelopes
preserve the juices with which while cooking, the
adhering fat, turned within, mingles and forms a gravy of
the finest flavour. Such is a feast in the mountains.</p>

<p>Since leaving Fort William we had been occasionally
crossing the trails of the Eutaw war parties, and had felt
some solicitude for the safety of our little band. An overwhelming
number of them might fall upon us at night and
annihilate us at a blow. But we had thus far selected such
encampments, and had such confidence in our rifles and in
our dog, who never failed to give us notice of the least
movement of a wolf or panther at night, that we had not
stationed a guard since leaving that post.</p>

<p>Our guide too sanctioned this course; always saying
when the subject was introduced that the dawn of day was
the time for Indian attacks, and that they would rise early
to find his eyes shut after the howl of the wolf on the hills
had announced the approach of light. We however took
the precaution to encamp at night in a deep woody glen,
which concealed the light of our fire, and slept with our
equipments {239} upon us, and our well primed rifles across
our breasts.</p>

<p>On the morning of the 21st we were awakened at sunrise,
by our servant who had thus early been in search of our
animals. The sun rose over the eastern mountains brilliantly,
and gave promise of a fine day. Our route lay
among vast swelling hills, the sides of which were covered
with groves of the large yellow pine and aspen. These
latter trees exclude every other from their society. They
stand so closely that not the half of their number live until
they are five inches in diameter. Those also that grow on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span>
the borders of the groves are generally destroyed, being
deprived of their bark seven or eight feet up, by the elk which
resort to them yearly to rub off the annual growth of their
horns. The snow on the tops of the hills was melting, and
along the lower edge of it, where the grass was green and
tender, herds of buffalo were grazing. So far distant were
they from the vales through which we travelled, that they
appeared a vast collection of dark specks on the line of the
sky.</p>

<p>By the side of the pebbly brooks, grew many beautiful
plants. A species of convolvulus and honeysuckle, two
species of {240} wild hops and the mountain flax, were
among them. Fruits were also beginning to appear; as
wild plums, currants, yellow and black; the latter like those
of the same colour in the gardens, the former larger than
either the red or black, but of an unpleasant astringent
flavour.&mdash;We had not, since entering the mountains, seen
any indication of volcanic action. The rocky strata and
the soil appeared to be of primary formation. We made
fifteen miles to-day in a general course of north by west.</p>

<p>On the 22nd we travelled eight miles through a country
similar to that we had passed the day before. We were
still on the waters of the Platte; but seldom in sight of the
main stream. Numerous noisy brooks ran among the hills
over which we rode. During the early part of the morning
buffalo bulls were often seen crossing our path: they
were however so poor and undesirable, that we shot none
of them. About ten o'clock we came upon a fresh trail,
distinctly marked by hoofs and dragging lodge poles. Kelly
judged these "signs" to be not more than twenty four hours
old, and to have been made by a party of Eutaws which
had passed into {241} Boyou Salade to hunt the buffalo.
Hostile Indians in our immediate neighbourhood was by
no means an agreeable circumstance to us. We could not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>
contend with any hope of success against one hundred and
fifty tomahawks and an equal number of muskets and bows
and arrows. They would also frighten the buffalo back to
the bull pen, and thus prevent us from laying in a stock of
meat farther along to support us across the desert in advance.
We therefore determined to kill the next bull that
we should meet, cure the best pieces for packing, and thus
prepare ourselves for a siege or a retreat, as circumstances
might dictate; or if the Indians should prevent our obtaining
other and better meat, and yet not interrupt us by any
hostile demonstration in pursuing our journey, we might, by
an economical use of what we could pack from this point,
be able to reach, before we should perish with hunger, the
game which we hoped to find on tributaries of Grand River.</p>

<p>We, therefore, moved on with great caution; and at about
two o'clock killed a fine young bull. He fell in a glen
through which a little brook murmured along to a copse
just below. The bulls in considerable {242} number were
manifesting their surplus wrath on the other side of the
little wood with as much apparent complacency as certain
animals with fewer legs and horns often do, when there
is not likely to be any thing in particular to oppose them.
But fortunately for the reputation of their pretensions, as
sometimes happens to their biped brethren, a circumstance
chanced to occur, when their courage seemed waxing to
the bursting state, on which it could expend its energies.
The blood of their slaughtered companions scented the
breeze, and on they came, twenty or more, tail in air, to take
proper vengeance.</p>

<p>We dropped our butcher knives, mounted quickly, and
were about to accommodate them with the contents of our
rifles, when, like many perpendicular bellowers, as certain
danger comes, they fled as bravely as they had approached.
Away they racked, for buffalo never trot, over the brown<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span>
barren hills in the north-east, looking neither to the right
nor left, for the long hair around the head does not permit
such aberrations of their optics; but onward gloriously did
they roll their massive bulks&mdash;now sinking in the vales
and now blowing up the ascents; stopping {243} not an
instant in their career until they looked like creeping insects
on the brow of the distant mountain. Having thus vanquished,
by the most consummate generalship and a stern
patriotism in the ranks never surpassed by Jew or Gentile,
these "abandoned rebels," we butchered our meat, and as
one of the works of returning peace, loaded it upon our
animals, and travelled in search of quaking-asp wood wherewithal
to dry it. The traders and trappers always prefer
this wood for such purposes, because, when dry, it is more
inodorous than any other; and consequently does not so
sensibly change the flavour of the meat dried over a fire
made of it. Half an hour's ride brought us to a grove of
this timber, where we encamped for the night&mdash;dried our
meat, and Eutaws near or far, slept soundly. In this remark
I should except, perhaps, the largest piece of human
nature among us, who had, as his custom was, curled down
hard-by our brave old guide and slept at intervals, only
an eye at a time, for fear of Indians.</p>

<p>23rd. Eighteen miles to-day among rough precipices,
overhanging crags, and roaring torrents. There were,
however, between the declivities and among the copses of
{244} cotton-wood, quaking-asp and fir, and yellow pine,
some open glades and beautiful valleys of green verdure,
watered by the rivulets gushing from the stony hills, and
sparkling with beautiful flowers. Five or six miles from
our last encampment, we came upon the brow of a woody
hill that overlooked the valley, where the waters on which
we were travelling unite with others that come down from
the mountains in the north, and from what is properly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>
called the south fork of the Great Platte, within the mountains.
Here we found fresh Indian tracks; and on that
account deemed it prudent to take to the timbered heights,
bordering the valley on the west, in order to ascertain the
position of the Indians, their numbers, &amp;c., before venturing
within their reach. We accordingly, for three hours,
wound our way in silence among fallen timber and thickset
cotton-wood; climbed every neighbouring height, and
examined the depressions in the plain, which could not be
seen from the lower hills.</p>

<p>Having searched the valley thoroughly in this manner, and,
perceiving from the peaceable and careless bearing of the
small bands of buffalo around its borders, {245} that if there
were Indians within it they were at some distance from
our trail, we descended from the heights, and struck through
a deep ravine across it, to the junction of the northern and
southern waters of the stream.</p>

<p>We found the river at this place a hundred and fifty yards
wide, and of an average depth of about six feet, with a
current of five miles the hour. Its course hence is E. N. E.
about one hundred miles, where it rushes through a magnificent
kenyon<a name="FNanchor_128" id="FNanchor_128"></a><a href="#Footnote_128" class="fnanchor">[128]</a> or chasm in the eastern range of the Rocky
Mountains to the plains of the Great Prairie Wilderness.
This valley is a congeries or collection of valleys. That is,
along the banks of the main and tributary streams a vale
extends a few rods or miles, nearly or quite separated from
a similar one beyond, by a rocky ridge or bute or a rounded
hill covered with grass or timber, which protrudes from
the height towards the stream. This is a bird's-eye view
of Boyou Salade, so named from the circumstance that
native rock salt is found in some parts of it. We were in
the central portion of it. To the north, and south, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span>west, its isolated plains rise one above the other, always
beautiful, and covered {246} with verdure during the months
of spring and summer. But when the storms of autumn
and winter come, they are the receptacles of vast bodies of
snow, which fall or are drifted there from the Anahuac
Ridge, on its western horizon. A sweet spot this, for the
romance of the future as well as the present and past. The
buffalo have for ages resorted here about the last days
of July, from the arid plains of the Arkansas and the Platte;
and thither the Eutaws and Cheyennes from the mountains
around the Santa F&eacute;, and the Shoshonies or Snakes
and Arrapahoes from the west, and the Blackfeet, Crows
and Sioux from the north, have for ages met, and hunted,
and fought, and loved. And when their battles and hunts
were interrupted by the chills and snows of November,
they have separated for their several winter resorts. How
wild and beautiful the past as it comes up fledged with the
plumage of the imagination!</p>

<p>These vales, studded with a thousand villages of conical
skin wigwams, with their thousands of fires blazing on the
starry brow of night! I see the dusky forms crouching
around the glowing piles of ignited logs, in family groups
whispering {247} the dreams of their rude love; or gathered
around the stalwart form of some noble chief at the hour
of midnight, listening to the harangue of vengeance or the
whoop of war, that is to cast the deadly arrow with the
first gleam of morning light. Or may we not see them
gathered, a circle of braves around an aged tree, surrounded
each by the musty trophies of half a century's
daring deeds. The eldest and richest in scalps, rises from
the centre of the ring and advances to the tree. Hear him:</p>

<p>"Fifty winters ago, when the seventh moon's first horn
hung over the green forests of the Eutaw hills, myself and
five others erected a lodge for the Great Spirit, on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span>
snows of the White Bute, and carried there our wampum
and skins and the hide of a white buffalo. We hung them
in the Great Spirit's lodge, and seated ourselves in silence
till the moon had descended the western mountain, and
thought of the blood of our fathers that the Cumanches had
killed when the moon was round and lay on the eastern
plain. My own father was scalped, and the fathers of five
others were scalped, and their bloody heads were gnawed
by the wolf. We could not live while our fathers' lodges
were empty, {248} and the scalps of their murderers were
not in the lodges of our mothers. Our hearts told us to
make these offerings to the Great Spirit who had fostered
them on the mountains; and when the moon was down,
and the shadows of the White Bute were as dark as the hair
of a bear, we said to the Great Spirit, 'No man can war
with the arrows from the quiver of thy storms; no man's
word can be heard when thy voice is among the clouds;
no man's hand is strong when thy hand lets loose its winds.
The wolf gnawed the heads of our fathers, and the scalps of
their murderers hang not in the lodges of our mothers.
Great father spirit, send not thine anger out; hold in thy
hand the winds; let not thy great voice drown the death-yell
while we hunt the murderers of our fathers.' I and
the five others then built in the middle of the lodge a fire,
and in its bright light the Great Spirit saw the wampum,
and the skin, and the white buffalo hide. Five days and
nights, I and the five others danced and smoked the medicine,
and beat the board with sticks, and chanted away
the power of the great Medicine, that they might not be
evil to us, and bring sickness into our bones. Then when
the stars were shining {249} in the clear sky, we swore (I
must not tell what, for it was in the ear of the Great Spirit)
and went out of the lodge with our bosoms full of anger
against the murderers of our fathers, whose bones were in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span>
the jaws of the wolf, and went for their scalps to hang them
in the lodges of our mothers. See him strike the aged
tree with his war club again, again, nine times. So many
Cumanches did I slay, the murderers of my father, before
the moon was round again, and lay upon the eastern plain."</p>

<p>This is not merely an imagined scene in former times in
Boyou Salade. All the essential incidents related, happened
yearly in that and other hunting grounds, whenever the old
braves assembled to celebrate the valorous deeds of their
younger days. When these exciting relations were finished,
the young men of the tribe, who had not yet distinguished
themselves, were exhorted to seek glory in a similar way.
Woe to him who passed his manhood without ornamenting
the door of his lodge with the scalps of his enemies!</p>

<p>This valley is still frequented by some of these tribes as a
summer haunt, when the heat of the plains renders them
uncomfortable. The Eutaws were scouring it when we
{250} passed. We therefore crossed the river to its northern
bank, and followed up its northern branch eight miles,<a name="FNanchor_129" id="FNanchor_129"></a><a href="#Footnote_129" class="fnanchor">[129]</a>
with every eye keenly searching for the appearance of foes;
and made our encampment for the night in a deep chasm,
overhung by the long branches of a grove of white pines.
We built our fire in the dry bed of a mountain torrent,
shaded by bushes on the side towards the valley, and above,
by a dense mass of boughs, so effectually, as not only to
conceal the blaze from any one in the valley, but also to prevent
the reflection from gilding too high the conspicuous
foliage of the neighbouring trees. After our horses had fed
themselves, we tied them close to our couches, that they
might not, in case of an attack, be driven away before we
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span>had an opportunity of defending them; and when we retired,
threw water upon our fire that it might not guide the
Indians in a search for us; put new caps upon our arms,
and trusting to our dog and mule, the latter in such cases
always the most skilful to scent their approach, tried to
sleep. But we were too near the snows. Chilling winds
sucked down the vale, and drove us from our blankets to
a shivering watch during the remainder of the night. Not
a cap, however, was burst. Alas! for {251} our brave
intentions, they ended in an ague fit.</p>

<p>Our guide informed us, that the Eutaws reside on both
sides of the Eutaw or Anahuac mountains; that they are
continually migrating from one side to the other; that
they speak the Spanish language; that some few half breeds
have embraced the Catholic faith; that the remainder yet
hold the simple and sublime faith of their forefathers, in
the existence of one great creating and sustaining cause,
mingled with a belief in the ghostly visitations of their
deceased Medicine men or diviners; and that they number
a thousand families. He also stated that the Cheyennes
are a band of renegadoes from the Eutaws and Cumanches;
and that they are less brave and more thievish than any other
tribe living in the plains south of Arkansas.<a name="FNanchor_130" id="FNanchor_130"></a><a href="#Footnote_130" class="fnanchor">[130]</a></p>

<p>We started at seven o'clock in the morning of the 24th,
travelled eight miles in a north by west direction, killed
another buffalo, and went into camp to jerk the meat.
Again we were among the frosts and snows and storms of
another dividing ridge. Our camp was on the height of land
between the waters of the Platte and those of Grand River, the
largest southern {252} branch of the Colorado of the west.<a name="FNanchor_131" id="FNanchor_131"></a><a href="#Footnote_131" class="fnanchor">[131]</a></p>

<p>From this eminence we had a fine view of Boyou
Salade, and also of the Anahuac range, which we had
before seen from the ridge between the Arkansas and
the southern waters of the Platte. To the south-east,
one hundred and sixty miles, towered the bald head of
James' Peak; to the east, one hundred miles distant, were
the broken and frowning cliffs through which the south
fork of the Platte, after having gathered all its mountain
tributaries, forces its roaring cascade course to the plains.
To the north, the low, timbered and grassy hills, some tipped
with snow, and others crowned with lofty pines, faded into
a smooth, dim, and regular horizon.</p>

charge of one of the brothers by that name, who were partners of the Bents. It
was situated on the right bank of the river near the easterly bend of the stream,
about opposite the mouth of St. Vrain's Creek, and some seventeen miles east of
Longs Peak. The site is still a landmark, being near the present Platteville,
Weld County. Fr&eacute;mont visited this fort on his journeys of 1842 and 1843, and
was hospitably entertained. Shortess, who went with what Farnham calls the
"mutineers," says they were detained six weeks at Fort St. Vrain, awaiting a party
bound for Green River. At this fort Dr. F. Adolph Wislizenus found them September
3, 1839, on his return journey from the mountains; see his <i>Ein Ausflug
nach den Felsen-Gebirgen</i> (St. Louis, 1840), a somewhat rare but interesting narrative
of his journey, written in German. He speaks of the fort as Penn's (Bents)
and Savory's, and found two other rival posts in the vicinity. This post was also
known as Fort George.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p></div>

speaks of it as being four miles above St. Vrain's, and occupied by French-Canadian

It was well known to early hunters for whom it remained a game paradise as late

his return in 1844, and witnessed an Indian battle there. Gold was discovered

<p>The ascent to this height was not so laborious as the one
near the Arkansas. It lay up the face of a mountain which
formed a larger angle with the plane of the horizon than
did the other. But it was clothed with a dense forest of
pines, a species of double-leaved hemlock, and spruce and
fir trees, which prevented our animals from {254} falling
over the precipices, and enabled us to make long sweeps in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span>a zigzag course, that much relieved the fatigue of the ascent.
We however met here a misfortune of a more serious nature
to us, than the storm that pelted us on the other ridge. One
of the horses belonging to our guide sickened just before
arriving at the summit, and refusing to bear farther the
burthen which he had heretofore borne with ease and
apparent pride, sunk under it. We roused him; he rose
upon his legs, and made a willing attempt to do his duty;
but the poor animal failed in his generous effort.</p>

<p>We, therefore, took off his pack, put it upon my saddle
horse, and drove him before us to the summit, from whence
we enjoyed the beautiful prospect we have just described.
But we felt little interest in the expanse of sublimity before
us; our eyes and sympathies, too, were turned to the noble
animal which was now suffering great pain. He had
been reared in the mountains; and it seemed to be his
highest pleasure to tread along their giddy brinks. Every
morning at his post, with the other horse belonging to his
master, he would {255} stand without being fastened, and
receive his burthen; and with every demonstration of
willingness, bear it over the mountains and through torrents
till his task was ended in the night encampment.
Such a horse, in the desolate regions we were traversing,
the bearer of our wearing apparel and food, the leader of
our band of animals, the property of our kind old Kentuckian,
the one-third of all his worldly estate, was no mean
object of interest. After noticing him awhile, we perceived
symptoms of his being poisoned, administered whatever
medicine we possessed suited to the case, and left him to
his fate for the night. Rain during the day, frost during
the night; ice in our camp kettles an inch in thickness.</p>

<p>We were out early on the morning of the 25th, and found
our guide's horse living. We accordingly saddled, packed
and started down the valley of a small head stream of Grand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span>
River.<a name="FNanchor_132" id="FNanchor_132"></a><a href="#Footnote_132" class="fnanchor">[132]</a> The sick horse was driven slowly along for about
five miles when he refused to go farther. It now became
evident that he had been eating the wild parsnips at our
last encampment on the other side of the ridge. That
he must die became, therefore, certain, and we unpacked
{256} to see the breath from his body before he should be
left to the merciless wolves. He died near daylight down,
and as the path before us was rough and bushy, we determined
to remain on the spot for the night. Our anxiety
for the life of this excellent animal had well nigh led us to
pass unobserved one of the most singular curiosities in
nature&mdash;a cross of crystallized quartz in the eastern face
of a conical mountain!</p>

<p>On the western side of the stream which we were following
down, were a collection of butes or conical peaks clustered
around one, the top of which was somewhat in the
form of the gable end of an ancient church. This cluster
was flanked on each side by vast rolls or swells of earth and
rock, which rose so high as to be capped with snow. In the
distance to the West, were seen through the openings between
the butes, a number of spiral peaks that imagination
could have said formed the western front of a vast holy
edifice of the eternal hills. On the eastern face of the gable
bute were two transverse seams of what appeared to be
crystallized quartz. The upright was about sixty feet in
length, the cross seam about twenty feet, thrown {257}
athwart the upright near its top and lying parallel to the
plane of the horizon. I viewed it as the sun rose over the
eastern mountains and fell upon the glittering crystals of
this emblem of the Saviour's suffering, built with the foundations<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span>
and treasured in the bosom of these granite solitudes.
A cross in a church, however fallen we may suppose it to be
from the original purity of worship, excites, as it should, in
the minds of all reasonable men, a sacred awe arising from
the remembrance of the scene in Judea which spread darkness
like the night over the earth and the sun. But how
much more impressive was this cross of living rock&mdash;on
the temple of nature where priest never trod; the symbol of
redeeming love, engraven when Eden was unscathed with
sin, by God's own hand on the brow of his everlasting mountains.</p>

<p>The trappers have reverently named this peak, the
"Mountain of the Holy Cross."<a name="FNanchor_133" id="FNanchor_133"></a><a href="#Footnote_133" class="fnanchor">[133]</a> It is about eight hundred
feet in height above the level of the little brook, which
runs a few rods from its base. The upper end of the cross
is about one hundred feet below the summit. There are
many dark {258} and stately groves of pine and balsam fir
in the vicinity. About the brooks grow the black alder,
the laurel, and honeysuckle, and a great variety of wild
flowers adorn the crevices of the rocks. The virgin snows
of ages whiten the lofty summits around; the voice of the
low murmuring rivulets trembles in the sacred silence: "O
solitude, thou art here," the lip moves to speak. "Pray,
kneel, adore," one seems to hear softly breathed in every
breeze. "It is holy ground."</p>

<p>26th. On march at six o'clock and travelled down the
small stream which had accompanied us on the 24th and
25th. As we advanced, the valleys opened, and the trees,
pine, fir, white oak, cotton wood, quaking-asp, &amp;c., became
larger and taller. The wild flowers and grass became<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span>
more luxuriant. As we were on an Indian trail, our course
was as nearly a right line as the eye of that race could trace
among the lower hills. Hence we often left the stream and
crossed the wood swells, not hills, not mountains; but vast
swelling tracts of land that rise among these vales like half
buried spheres, on which, frequently for miles about us,
pine and fir trees of the largest {259} size had been prostrated
by the winds. To leap our animals over these, and among
them, and into them, and out of them, and still among them,
floundering, tearing packs and riders&mdash;running against
knots and tumbling upon splintery stubs and rocks, were
among the amusements of getting through them. The
groves of small quaking-asp too, having been killed by the
elk, in some places had fallen across our track so thickly
that it became necessary to raise the foot over one at almost
every step.</p>

<p>Here my Puebla mare performed many a feat of "high
and lofty tumbling." She could leap the large pines, one
at a time, with satisfaction to herself, that was worthy of
her blood. But to step, merely step, over one small tree
and then over another, seemed to be too much condescension.
Accordingly she took a firm unalterable stand upon
her reserved rights, from which neither pulling nor whipping
seemed likely to move her. At length she yielded, as
great men sometimes do, her own opinion of constitutional
duty to the will of the people, and leaped among them with
a desperation that ought to have annihilated a square mile
of such obstacles. But instead {260} thereof, she turned a
somersault into about the same quantity of them, and
there lay "alone in her glory," till she was tumbled out and
set up again.</p>

<p>The valley, during the day's journey, had appeared five
miles in width.<a name="FNanchor_134" id="FNanchor_134"></a><a href="#Footnote_134" class="fnanchor">[134]</a> On its borders hung dark mountains of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span>rock, some of which lying westward, were tipped with
shining ice. Far beyond these appeared the Anahuac
ridge. Snow in the south was yet in sight&mdash;none seen in
the east north. The valley itself was much broken, with
minor rocky declivities, bursting up between the "swells,"
and with fields of large loose stones laid bare by the torrents.
The buffalo were seen grazing in small detached
herds on the slopes of the mountains near the lower line of
snow, those green fields of the skies. Many "elk signs,"
tracks, &amp;c., were met; but none of these animals were seen.
Our guide informed me that their habit is to "follow the
snow." In other words, that as the snow in summer melts
away from the lowlands, they follow its retiring banks into
the mountains; and when it begins in autumn to descend
again, they descend with it, and pass the winter in the valley.
{261} He also accounted for the absence of the male deer
in a similar way; and added that the does, when they bring
forth their young, forsake their male companions until the
kids are four or five months old; and this for the reason that
the unnatural male is disposed to destroy his offspring during
the period of its helplessness. Some rain fell to-day.</p>

<p>27th. We commenced our march this morning at six
o'clock, travelled, as our custom usually was, till the hour
of eleven, and then halted to breakfast, on the bank of the
stream. The face of the country along the morning's trail
was much the same as that passed over the day before; often
beautiful, but oftener sublime. Vast spherical swells covered
with buffalo, and wild flowering glens echoing the voices
of a thousand cascades, and countless numbers of lofty
peaks crowding the sky, will give perhaps a faint idea of it.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span>As the stream that we had been following bore to the westward
of our course, we in the afternoon struck across a
range of low hills to another branch of it that came down
from the eastern mountains, and encamped upon its banks.
These hills were composed of hard gravel, covered with
two or three inches of {262} black loam. In the deep vales
the mountain torrents had swept away the soil, and left the
strata bare for miles along their courses. The mountain
flax and the large thistle flourished everywhere. The timber
was the same in kind as we had passed the three last
days. The groves were principally confined to the lower
portions of the ravines which swept down from the snowy
heights. The Anahuac range in the west appeared to dip
deeper in the horizon, and recede farther from us. One
half only of its altitude as seen from the dividing ridges was
now visible. We were doubtless lessening our own altitude
materially, but the difference in the apparent height of this
ridge was in part produced by its increased distance. It
had evidently begun to tend rapidly towards the Pacific.</p>

<p>An aged knight of the order of horns strode across our
path near four o'clock, and by his princely bearing invited
our trapper to a tilt. His Kentucky blood could not be
challenged with impunity. He dropped upon one knee&mdash;drew
a close sight&mdash;clove the bull's heart in twain, and
sent him groaning upon the sand. He was very poor, but
as we had reason to fear that we were leaving the buffalo
{263} "beat," it was deemed prudent to increase the weight
of our pack with the better portion of his flesh. Accordingly
the tongue, heart, leaf fat and the "fleece" were taken, and
were being lashed to our mule, when an attack of bilious
bravery seized our giant in the extremities, and he began
to kick and beat his horse for presuming to stand upon four
legs, or some similar act, without his permission, in such
gallant style, that our mule on which the meat was placed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span>
leaped affrighted from us and dropped it on the sand. We
were all extremely vexed at this, and I believe made some
disparaging comparisons between the intellects of asses and
tyrants. Whether our mule or Smith felt most aggrieved
thereby we were never informed. But the matter was very
pleasantly disposed of by our benevolent old guide. He
turned the meat with his foot and kicked it good-naturedly
from him, saying in his blandest manner, "No dirt in the
mounting but sand; the teeth can't go that;" and mounted
his horse for the march. We travelled twenty miles and
encamped.</p>

<p>28th. Eighteen miles down the small valleys between
the sharp and rugged hills; crossed a number of small
streams running {264} westward. The mountains along
our way differed in character from any we had heretofore
passed. Some of them were composed entirely of earth,
and semi-elliptical in form; others embraced thousands of
acres of what seemed to be mere elevations of fine brown
gravel, rising swell above swell, and sweeping away to the
height of two thousand feet, destitute of timber save a few
slender strips which grew along the rills that trickled at
long intervals down their sides.<a name="FNanchor_135" id="FNanchor_135"></a><a href="#Footnote_135" class="fnanchor">[135]</a> We encamped again on
the bank of the main stream. It was one hundred yards
in width; water a foot and a half deep, current six miles
the hour.</p>

<p>29th. To-day we struck Grand River, (the great southern
branch of the Colorado of the west), twenty miles from our
last night's encampment. It is here three hundred yards
wide; current, six miles the hour; water, from six to ten
feet in depth, transparent, but, like the atmosphere, of much
higher temperature than we had met with since leaving the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span>
Arkansas. The valleys that lie upon this stream and some
of its tributaries, are called by the hunters "The Old Park."
If the qualifying term were omitted, they would be well
described by their name.<a name="FNanchor_136" id="FNanchor_136"></a><a href="#Footnote_136" class="fnanchor">[136]</a> Extensive meadows running
{265} up the valleys of the streams, woodlands skirting the
mountain bases and dividing the plains, over which the
antelope, black and white-tailed deer, the English hare,
the big horn or mountain sheep, the grisly, grey, red and
black bears, and the buffalo and elk range&mdash;a splendid
park indeed; not old, but new as in the first fresh morning
of the creation.</p>

<p>Here also are found the prairie and the large grey wolf,
the American panther, beaver, polecat, and land otter. The
grisly bear is the largest and most ferocious&mdash;with hair of
a dirty-brown colour, slightly mixed with those of a yellowish
white. The males not unfrequently weigh five or six hundred
pounds. The grey bear is less in size, hair nearly
black, interspersed along the shoulders and hips with white.
The red is still less, according to the trappers, and of the
colour indicated by the name. The black bear is the same
in all respects as those inhabiting the States. The prairie
dog is also found here, a singular animal, partially described
in a previous page; but as they may be better known from
Lieutenant Pike's description of them, I shall here introduce
it:<a name="FNanchor_137" id="FNanchor_137"></a><a href="#Footnote_137" class="fnanchor">[137]</a> "They live in towns and villages, having an evident
police established {266} in their communities. The sites
of these towns are generally on the brow of a hill, near some
creek or pond, in order to be convenient to water and to be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span>exempt from inundation. Their residence is in burrows,
which descend in spiral form." The Lieutenant caused
one hundred and forty kettles of water to be poured into one
of their holes in order to drive out the occupant, but failed.
"They never travel more than half a mile from their homes,
and readily associate with rattlesnakes. They are of a
dark brown colour, except their bellies, which are red.
They are something larger than a grey squirrel, and very
fat; supposed to be graminivorous. Their villages sometimes
extend over two or three miles square, in which there
must be innumerable hosts of them, as there is generally
a burrow every ten steps. As you approach the towns,
you are saluted on all sides by the cry of "<i>wishtonwish</i>,"
uttered in a shrill piercing manner."</p>

<p>The birds of these regions are the sparrow-hawk, the
jack-daw, a species of grouse of the size of the English
grouse; colour brown, a tufted head, and limbs feathered
to the feet; the raven, very large, turkey, turkey-buzzards,
geese, all the varieties of ducks {267} known in such latitudes,
the bald and grey eagle, meadow lark and robin red breast.
Of reptiles, the small striped lizard, horned frog and garter
snake are the most common. Rattlesnakes are said to be
found among the cliffs, but I saw none.</p>

<p>We forded Grand River, and encamped in the willows on
the northern shore. The mountains in the west, on which
the snow was lying, were still in sight. The view to the
east and south was shut in by the neighbouring hills; to
the north and north-east it was open, and in the distance
appeared the Wind River and other mountains, in the
vicinity of the 'Great Gap.'<a name="FNanchor_138" id="FNanchor_138"></a><a href="#Footnote_138" class="fnanchor">[138]</a></p>

<p>During the evening, while the men were angling for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span>
trout, Kelly gave me some account of Grand River and the
Colorado of the west. Grand River, he said, is a branch
of the Colorado.<a name="FNanchor_139" id="FNanchor_139"></a><a href="#Footnote_139" class="fnanchor">[139]</a> It rises far in the east among the precipitous
heights of the eastern range of the Rocky Mountains,
about midway from the Great Gap and the Kenyon
of the south Fork of the Platte. It interlocks the distance
of sixty miles with the waters of the Great Platte; its
course to the point where we crossed, is nearly due west.
Thence it continues in a west by north course one hundred
and {268} sixty miles, where it breaks through the Anahuac
Ridge. The cliffs of this Kenyon are said to be many
hundred feet high, and overhanging; within them is a
series of cascades, which, when the river is swollen by the
freshets in June, roar like Niagara.<a name="FNanchor_140" id="FNanchor_140"></a><a href="#Footnote_140" class="fnanchor">[140]</a></p>

<p>After passing this Kenyon, it is said to move with a dashing,
foaming current in a westerly direction fifty miles,
where it unites with Green River, or Sheetskadee, and
forms the Colorado of the west. From the junction of these
branches the Colorado has a general course from the north-east
to the south-west, of seven hundred miles to the head
of the Gulf of California. Four hundred of this seven
hundred miles is an almost unbroken chasm of Kenyon,
with perpendicular sides, hundreds of feet in height, at the
bottom of which the waters rush over continuous cascades.
This Kenyon terminates thirty miles above the Gulf. To
this point the river is navigable.<a name="FNanchor_141" id="FNanchor_141"></a><a href="#Footnote_141" class="fnanchor">[141]</a> The country on each
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span>side of its whole course is a rolling desert of brown loose
earth, on which the rains and dews never fall.</p>

<p>A few years since, two Catholic Missionaries and their
servants, on their way from the mountains to California,
attempted to descend the Colorado. They have never {269}
been seen since the morning they commenced their fatal
undertaking.<a name="FNanchor_142" id="FNanchor_142"></a><a href="#Footnote_142" class="fnanchor">[142]</a> A party of trappers and others made a
strong boat and manned it well, with the determination of
floating down the river to take the beaver, which they supposed
to live along its banks; but they found themselves in
such danger after entering the kenyon, that with might and
main they thrust their trembling boat ashore, and succeeded
in leaping upon the crags, and lightening it before it was
swallowed in the dashing torrent. But the death which
they had escaped in the stream, still threatened them on
the crags. Perpendicular and overhanging rocks frowned
above them; these they could not ascend. They could not
cross the river; they could not ascend the river, and the
foaming cascades below forbade the thought of committing
themselves again to their boat.</p>

<p>Night came on, and the difficulty of keeping their boat
from being broken to pieces on the rocks, increased the anxieties
of their situation. They must have passed a horrible
night; so full of fearful expectations, of the certainty of
starvation on the crags, or drowning in the stream. In the
morning, however, they examined the rocks again, and
found a small projecting crag {270} some twenty feet above
them, over which, after many efforts, they threw their small
boat-rope and drew the noose tight. One of their number<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span>
then climbed to explore. He found a platform above the
crag, of sufficient size to contain his six companions, and a
narrow chasm in the overhanging wall through which it
appeared possible to pass to the upper surface. Having all
reached the platform, they unloosed their lasso, and, bracing
themselves as well as they could, with their rifles in the
moving, dry earth beneath their feet, they undertook the
ascent. It was so steep that they were often in danger of
being plunged together in the abyss below. But by digging
steps in the rocks, (where they could be dug with their rifle-barrels),
and by making use of their lasso where it could be
used, they reached the upper surface near sunset, and
made their way back to the place of departure.<a name="FNanchor_143" id="FNanchor_143"></a><a href="#Footnote_143" class="fnanchor">[143]</a></p>

<p>This is a mountain legend, interesting, indeed, but&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"I cannot tell how the truth may be,<br /></span>

</div></div>

<p>At daylight, on the 30th, our cavalcade was moving
across the woody ridges and verdant valleys between the
crossings of {271} Grand River and its great north fork.<a name="FNanchor_144" id="FNanchor_144"></a><a href="#Footnote_144" class="fnanchor">[144]</a>
We struck that stream about ten o'clock. Its water was
beautifully clear, average depth two feet, and current four
miles the hour. It is said to take its rise in the mountains,
near the south side of the 'Great Gap,' and to flow, in a
south-westerly course, through a country of broken and barren
plains, into Grand River, twenty miles below the crossings.
We ascended rapidly all the day. There was no
trail to guide us; but our worthy guide knew every moun<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span>tain-top
in sight. Bee lines through immense fields of
wild sage and wormwood, and over gravelly plains&mdash;a
short halt for a short breakfast&mdash;constant spurring, and
trotting, and driving, deposited us at sunset, at the foot of
a lofty mountain, clothed with heavy timber. This was
the dividing ridge between the waters of Grand and Green
Rivers. It was necessary to cross it. We therefore, turned
out the animals to feed, ate a scanty morsel of dried meat,
and went to our couches, for the strength requisite for the
task. About the middle of the night the panthers on the
mountain gave us a specimen of their growling capacities.
It was a hideous noise: deep and broken by the most unearthly
screams! They were gathering for prey; {272} for
our horses and ourselves. We drove up the animals, however,
tied them near the camp, built a large and bright fire,
and slept till daylight.</p>

<p>At sunrise, on the morning of the 31st, we stood on the
summit of the mountain, at the base of which we had slept
the previous night.<a name="FNanchor_145" id="FNanchor_145"></a><a href="#Footnote_145" class="fnanchor">[145]</a> It was the very place from which I
wished to view the outline of the valley of Grand River, and
the snowy ridge of the Anahuac; and it was as favourable
an hour for my purpose as I could have selected from the
whole day. The sun had just risen over the eastern heights,
sufficiently to give the valley of the Grand River to the
south-east of me, those strong contrasts of light and shade
which painters know so well how to use when sketching a
mountain scene at early morning, or when the sun is half
hidden at night. The peaks were bright, the deep shadows
sprang off from the western sides, above faintly, and deepening
as they descended to the bases, where the deep brown
of the rocks and earth gave the vales the semblance of undisturbed
night.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span></p>

<p>The depression of the valley, as I have termed it, was in
truth a depression of a vast tract of mountains; not unto a
plane {273} or vale; but a great ravine of butes and ridges,
decreasing in height from the limit of vision in the north-east,
east and south&mdash;and falling one below another toward
the stream, into the diminutive bluffs on its banks.
The valley below the crossing was less distinctly seen. Its
general course only could be distinguished among the
bare hills upon its borders. But the great main chain, or
Anahuac range, came sweeping up from the Arkansas more
sublime, if possible, in its aspect than when viewed from
the heights farther south. It was about one hundred miles
distant, the length of the section in view about one hundred
and sixty; not a speck on all its vast outline. It did
not show as glaciers do; but like a drift of newly-fallen
snow heaped on mountains, by some mighty efforts of the
elements; piled from age to age; and from day to day
widening and heightening its untold dimensions. Its width,
its height, its cubic miles, its mass of rock, of earth, of snow,
of ice, of waters ascending in clouds to shower the lowlands
or renew its own robes of frosts, of waters sent rushing to
the seas, are some of the vast items of this sublimity of
existence. The light of the rising {274} sun falling upon it
through the remarkable transparent atmosphere of these
regions, made the view exceedingly distinct. The intervening
space was thickly dotted with lesser peaks, which,
in the lengthened distance, melted into an apparent plain.
But the elevation of the great Anahuac ridge, presenting its
broad, white side to the morning light in that dry, clear,
upper air, seemed as distinctly seen as the tree at my side.
In the north-west it manifestly tended toward the north end
of the Great Salt Lake. But I must leave this absorbing
scene for the journey of the day. The ascent of the dividing
ridge, from which I took this extensive survey of all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span>
this vast, unknown, unexplored portion of the mountains,
was comparatively easy. We threaded, indeed, some half
dozen precipices in going up, within an inch of graves five
hundred feet deep. Yet, as none of us lost our brains on
the rocks below, these narrow and slippery paths can not
be remembered in connexion with incidents either remarkable
or sad.</p>

<p>With this notice of mountain turnpikes, I shall be obliged
to my readers to step along with me over the bold summit
and look at the descent, yes, the <i>descent</i>, my friends. {275}
It is a bold one: one of the men said "four miles of perpendicular;"
and so it was. Or if it was not, it ought to have
been, for many very good reasons of mathematical propriety
that are as difficult to write as to comprehend. It
was partially covered with bushes and trees, and a soft vegetable
mould that yielded to our horses' feet, but we, by dint
of holding, bracing, and sliding, arrived safely at the bottom,
and jogged on merrily six or seven miles over barren
ridges, rich plains, and woody hills to the head of Tumbleton
park. We had turned out our animals to eat, hung our
camp-kettle over the fire to boil some bits of grisly meat
that we had found among the rubbish of our packs, and
were resting our wearied frames in the shade of the willows,
conversing about the tracts which we had seen five miles
back; one supposing that they were made by Indians, the
Arrapahoes or the Shoshonies, while our old guide insisted
that they were made by white men's horses! and assigned
as a reason for this opinion, that no Indians could be travelling
in that direction, and that one of the horses had shoes
on its fore feet; when the Arrapahoe war-whoop and the
clattering of hoofs upon the side hill above, brought us to
our feet, rifle in hand, {276} for a conflict. Kelly seemed
for a moment to be in doubt as to his own conclusions
relative to the tracks, and as to the colour of those uncere<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span>monious
visitors. But as they dashed up, he leaped the
brook, and seized the hands of three old fellow-trappers.
It was a joyful meeting. They had often stood side by
side in battle, and among the solemn mountains dug the
lonely grave of some slaughtered companion, and together
sent the avenging lead into the hearts of the Blackfeet.
They were more than brothers, and so they met. We
shared with them our last scraps of meat.</p>

<p>They informed us that they had fallen in with our trail,
and followed us under a belief that we were certain friends
whom they were expecting from St. Louis with goods for
the post at Brown's Hole; that the Arrapahoes were fattening
on buffalo in the Bull Pen, on the north fork of the
Platte;<a name="FNanchor_146" id="FNanchor_146"></a><a href="#Footnote_146" class="fnanchor">[146]</a> that the Shoshonies or Snakes were starving on
roots on Great Bear River; that the Blackfeet and Sioux
were in the neighbourhood; that there was no game in the
mountains except on the head waters of Snake River; and
that they themselves were a portion of a party of white men,
Indians, and squaws, on their way to Bent's Fort on the
{277} Arkansas, to meet Mr. Thomson with the goods
before named; that we might reasonably anticipate starvation
and the arrows of the Sioux, and other kindred comforts
along our journey to Brown's Hole. Mr. Craig, the
chief of the party, and part owner with Mr. Thomson,
assured us that the grass on the Columbia was already
dry and scarce; and if there should prove to be enough to
sustain our horses on the way down, that the snows on the
Blue Mountains would prevent us from reaching Vancouver
till the spring, and kindly invited us to pass the winter at
his post. After two hours' tarry with us he and his party
returned to their camp.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span></p>

<p>Tumbleton's Park is a beautiful savannah, stretching
north-westerly from our camp in an irregular manner among
groves of pine, spruce, fir, and oak.<a name="FNanchor_147" id="FNanchor_147"></a><a href="#Footnote_147" class="fnanchor">[147]</a> Three hundred
yards from us rose Tumbleton's Rock, one of those singular
spires found in the valley of the mountains, called
Butes. It was about eighty feet in height, twenty feet in
diameter at the base, and terminated at the top in a point.
Soon after our new acquaintances had left us, we "caught
up" and struck across the hills in a north-easterly course
toward the north fork of Little Bear River. The travelling
was very rough, now among {278} fields of loose stones and
bushes, and now among dense forests; no trail to aid us in
finding our way; new ground even to our guide. But he
was infallible.</p>

<p>Two hours' riding had brought us upon an Indian trail
that he had heard of ten years before; and on we rushed
among the fallen pines, two feet, three feet in diameter,
raised, as you see, one foot, two feet from the ground. The
horses and mules are testing their leaping powers. Over
they go, and tip off riders and packs, &amp;c., &amp;c. A merry
time this. There goes my Puebla mare, head, heels, and
neck, into an acre of crazy logs. Ho, halt! Puebla's
down, mortally wounded with want of strength! She's unpacked,
and out in a trice; we move on again. Ho! whistle
that mule into the track! he'll be off that ledge there. Move
them on! move! cut down that sapling by the low part of
that fallen tree! drive over Puebla! There she goes! long
legs a benefit in bestriding forests. Hold! hold! hold! that
pack-horse yonder has anchored upon a pine! Dismount!
back her out! she has hung one side of herself and pack upon
that knot! away! ho! But silence! a deer springs up in
yonder thicket! Kelly creeps forward&mdash;halt! hush! {279}<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span>
hu! Ah! the varlet! he is gone; a murrain on his fat
loins! a poor supper we'll have to-night! no meat left,
not a particle; nor coffee, tea, nor salt! custom of society
here to starve! suppose you will conform! Stay, here's
trouble! but they move! one goes down well! another,
another, and another! My Puebla mare, reader, that six
foot frame standing there, hesitating to descend that narrow
track around the precipice! she goes over it! bravely
done! A ten feet leap! and pack and all stuck in the mud.
That mule, also, is down in the quagmire! a lift at the pack
there, man! the active, tireless creature! he's up and off.
Guide, this forest is endless! shan't get out to-night. But
here we go merrily onward! It is dark enough for the
frogs of Egypt! Halt! halt! ho! Puebla down again&mdash;laid
out among the logs! Pull away upon that pack there,
man! help the sinner to her feet again for another attempt
to kill herself. Beautiful pines, firs, and hemlocks, these,
reader; but a sack of hurricanes has been let loose among
them not long since. The prostrate shingle timber, eh?
'twould cover a roof over the city of London; and make a
railroad to run the Thames into Holland. Halt! halt!
unpack! we camp here to-night.</p>

<p>{280} A little prairie this, embosomed, nestled, &amp;c., among
the sweet evergreen woodlands. Wait a little now, reader,
till we turn these animals loose to feed, and we'll strike up
a fire wherewithal to dry our wet garments, and disperse a
portion of this darkness. It is difficult kindling this wet
bark. Joseph, sing a song; find a hollow tree; get some
dry leaves. That horse is making into the forest! better tie
him to a bough! That's it; Joseph, that's a youthful blaze!
give it strength! feed it oxygen! it grows. Now for our
guest. Seat yourself, sir, on that log; rather damp comfort&mdash;the
best we have&mdash;homespun fare&mdash;the ton of the
country! We're in the primeval state, sir. We regret our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span>
inability to furnish you food, sir. But as we have not, for
the last few days indulged much in that merely animal
gratification, we beg you to accommodate yourself with a
dish of Transcendentalism; and with us await patiently a
broiled steak a few days along the track of time to come.</p>

<p>It was ten o'clock at night when we arrived at this encampment.
It had been raining in torrents ever since nightfall.
The rippling of a small stream had guided us after the
darkness shut in. Drenched with rain, {281} shivering with
cold, destitute of food, and with the appetite of wolves, we
availed ourselves of the only comforts within our reach&mdash;a
cheering pine-knot fire, and such sleep as we could get
under the open heavens in a pelting storm.</p>

<p>The general face of the country through which the afternoon's
travel had carried us, was much broken; but the
inequalities, or hills and valleys, to a very considerable
extent, were covered with a rich vegetable loam, supporting
a heavy growth of pine, spruce, quaking-asp, &amp;c. The
glades that intervened were more beautiful than I had seen.
Many were covered with a heavy growth of timothy or herds
grass, and red top in blossom. Large tracts in the skirts of
the timber were thickly set with Sweet-Sicily. The mountain
flax was very abundant. I had previously seen it in
small patches only; but here it covered acres as densely as
it usually stands in fields, and presented the beautiful sheet
of blue blossoms so graceful to the lords of the plough.</p>

<p>I had noticed some days previously, a few blades of the
grasses just named, standing in a clump of bushes; but we
were riding rapidly, and could not stop to examine {282}
them, and I was disposed to think that my sight had deceived
me. What! the tame grasses of Europe, all that are
valuable for stock, the best and most sought by every intelligent
farmer in Christendom; these indigenous to the vales
of the Rocky mountains? It was even so.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span></p>

<p>August 1st. As our horses had found little to eat during
the past night, and seemed much worn by the exceeding
fatigues of the previous day, we at early dawn drew them
around our camp, loaded the strongest of them with our
packs, and led and drove the poor animals through three
miles more of standing and fallen timber, to the opening
on Little Bear River, and turned them loose to feed upon
the first good grass that we found.<a name="FNanchor_148" id="FNanchor_148"></a><a href="#Footnote_148" class="fnanchor">[148]</a> It chanced to be in
one of Kelly's old encampments; where he had, some years
before, fortified himself with logs, and remained seven days
with a sick fellow trapper. At that time the valley was alive
with hostile Indians; but the good man valued the holy
principles of humanity more than his life, and readily put it
at hazard to save that of his companion. "A fearful time
that," said he; "the redskins saw every turn of our heads
during those seven days and nights. But I baited our
horses within {283} reach of my rifle during the day, and put
them in that pen at night; so that they could not rush off
with them, without losing their brains. The buffalo were
plenty here then. The mountains were then rich. The
bulls were so bold that they would come close to the fence
there at night, and bellow and roar till I eased them of
their blood by a pill of lead in the liver. So you see I did
not go far for meat. Now, the mountains are so poor that
one would stand a right good chance of starving, if he were
obliged to hang up here for seven days. The game is all
driven out. No place here for a white man now. Too
poor, too poor. What little we get, you see, is bull beef.
Formerly, we ate nothing but cows, fat and young. More
danger then, to be sure; but more beaver too; and plenty
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span>of grease about the buffalo ribs. Ah! those were good
times; but a white man has no more business here."</p>

<p>Our general course since entering the mountains at the
Arkansas, had been north-west by west. It now changed
to north-west by north. Our horses and mules, having
eaten to their satisfaction the rich grass about our guide's
old encampment, we moved on down Little Bear River.
The {284} country, as we descended, became more and
more barren.</p>

<p>The hills were destitute of timber and grasses; the plains
bore nothing but prickly pear and wild wormwood. The
latter is a shrub growing from two to six feet in height.
It branches in all directions from the root. The main stem
is from two to four inches in diameter at the ground, the
bark rough, of a light greyish colour and very thin. The
wood is firm, fine grained, and difficult to break. The
leaves are larger, but resemble in form and colour those of
the common wormwood of the gardens. The flavour is
that of a compound of garden wormwood and sage: hence
it has received the names of "wild wormwood" and "wild
sage." Its stiff and knotty branches are peculiarly unpleasant
to the traveller among them. It stands so thickly
over thousands of acres of the mountain valleys, that it is
well nigh impossible to urge a horse through it; and the
individual who is rash enough to attempt it, will himself be
likely to be deprived of his moccasins, and his horse of his
natural covering of his legs. There are two species of the
prickly pear (cactus) here. The one is the plant of low
growth, thick elliptical leaves armed with thorns, {285} the
same as is found in the gardens of certain curious people
in the States; the other is of higher growth, often reaching
three feet; the colour is a deep green. It is a columnar
plant without a leaf; the surface of the stalk is checked into
diamonds of the most perfect proportions, swelling regularly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span>
from the sides to the centre. At the corners of these figures
grow strong thorns, from an inch to an inch and a half in
length. Six inches from the ground, branches shoot from
the parent stalk in all directions, making an angle with it of
about forty-five degrees, and growing shorter as the point of
union with the central stalk increases in height. The consistency
of the whole plant is alternately pulpy and fibrous.
We were making our tedious way among these thorny companions,
musing upon our empty stomachs, when we were
overtaken by two men, a squaw and child, from Craig's
party. They made their camp with us at night. Nothing
to eat, starving and weak; we followed the example of the
squaw, in eating the inner portion of large thistle-stalks.</p>

<p>2nd. We rose at daybreak, somewhat refreshed by sleep,
but weak, weak, having eaten but little for four days. The
longings {286} of appetite&mdash;they are horrible! Our guide
was used to long fasts, and was therefore little incommoded.
He, however, had been out with his rifle, since the peep of
day, and as we were lifting the packs upon our mules, it
cracked in the direction of the trail we were about to travel.
We hastened away to him with the eagerness of starving
men, and found him resting unconcernedly upon his rifle,
waiting for us to enjoy with him the roasted loins of an elk,
which had tumbled from a neighbouring cliff, in obedience
to his unerring aim.</p>

<p>Leaving his saddle-horse to pack the meat on, passed
along a mile, and encamped among the willows on the bank
of Little Bear River. The first work, after turning loose
our animals, was to build a fire to cook meat. Our squaw
companion thought otherwise. She selected a place for her
camp beneath the willows, cleared a spot wide enough for
her bed, formed an arch of the boughs overhead, covered it
with a piece of buffalo tent leather, unloosed her infant from
its prison, and laid it upon skins in the shade she had formed.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span>
After this, the horses of herself and husband were unharnessed,
and turned loose to feed. She was a good, cleanly,
affectionate body, {287} equally devoted to the happiness of
her child, husband, and horses; and seemed disposed to
initiate us into every little piece of knowledge that would
enable us to discover the wild edible roots of the country,
the best method of taking fish, hoppling horses, tying knots
in ropes, repairing saddles, &amp;c., which experience had
taught her.</p>

<p>Our fire had just begun to burn brightly, when our guide
arrived with the elk. It was very much bruised by its fall
from the cliff when shot. Yet it was meat; it was broiled;
it was eaten; it was sweet. No bread, or vegetables, or
salt, to the contrary, it was delicious. Four days' fasting
is confessed to be an excellent panacea for a bad appetite;
and as all good and wholesome rules work both ways, it is
without doubt a <i>tasteful</i> addition to bad food. I must, however,
bear my humble testimony to the fact, that meat alone,
unqualified with gravy, unsprinkled with salt or pepper,
unaided by any vegetable or farinaceous accompaniment,
is excellent food for men. It neither makes them tigers nor
crocodiles. On the contrary, it prevents starvation, when
nothing else can be had, and cultivates industry, the parent
of virtue, in all the multiplied departments of the gastric
system.</p>

<p>{288} 3rd. Remained in camp all day to refresh our
animals, to eat, and hear yarns of mountain life. During
these conversations, the great dangers of a residence among
the mountains was often reverted to. One class of them was
said to arise from the increasing scarcity of buffalo and
beaver among them. This circumstance compelled the
trappers to move over a wide range of country, and consequently,
multiplied the chances of falling in with the
Sioux and Blackfeet, their deadliest enemies&mdash;enemies on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span>
whom no dependence could be placed other than this, that
they always fight well whenever and wherever met. Our
new friends related, in this connexion, the death of one
of their old companions, a brave old trapper of the name
of Redman. This man, and another called Markhead,
were trapping on the head-waters of Green River, when
they were discovered by a war party of young Sioux, and
robbed of their horses. This was a great annoyance to
them. The loss of the value of their animals was inconvenient
for the poor men; but the loss of their services in
transporting their traps and furs, and "possibles," (clothing,
cooking utensils, &amp;c.,) was severely felt. It was necessary
to recover them, or "<i>cache</i>;" that is, bury in some secret place
in the dry sand, {289} their remaining property: forsake
their hunt, and abandon all their prospects of gain for the
season. Redman had lived with the Sioux, and relying
on their former friendship for him in their village, determined
to go with Markhead, and attempt to reason a Sioux war
party into a surrender of their plunder. They approached
them rifle in hand, and held a parley near the Pilot Bute.<a name="FNanchor_149" id="FNanchor_149"></a><a href="#Footnote_149" class="fnanchor">[149]</a>
The result was, that the Indians demanded and obtained
their rifles, discharged them at their owners, killed Redman
instantly, and severely wounded his companion. This
occurred in the spring of 1839.</p>

<p>4th. We were early on route this morning, down the
banks of Little Bear River; course north-west. Our track
lay so low, that the mountains were seldom seen. A portion
of the Anahuac ridge in the south-west, was the only
height constantly in view. The plains, as they are called,
on either side of the river, were cut into vast ravines and
bluffs. In their side sometimes appeared a thin stratum
of slate. Few other rocky strata were seen during a march<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span>
of fifteen miles. About twelve o'clock, we came upon a
cave formed by the limestone and sulphur deposit of a
small stream that burst from a hill hard by. The water
had, {290} by constant depositions, formed an elevated
channel some five rods down the face of the hillside, at the
termination of which it spread itself over a circular surface
of one hundred and fifty or two hundred feet in circumference.
In the centre of this, was an orifice, down which
the water trickled into the cave below. As little of the cave
could be seen from the ground above, myself and two others
attempted to explore it. We found the roof hung with
beautifully crystallized sulphur, and the bottom strewn with
large quantities of the same material in a pulverized state.
The odour was so offensive, however, that we were glad to
retreat before we had formed a very perfect estimate of its
extent and contents. It was about six rods long, eight
feet wide, and four feet high. Near it were a number of
warm springs. On the bluff, a few rods above it, was a
small tract of fused rocks. In all the circle of vision, however,
there were no elevations that indicate any powerful
volcanic action in former times; nor any from which these
rocks could have tumbled or been thrown. The warm
springs, however, in the vicinity may, perhaps, indicate
their origin.</p>

<p>The face of the country passed to-day {291} was dry and
barren. A single quaking-asp tree here and there on the
sterile bottom lands, and small strips of cotton wood, whose
tops peered from the deep gorges just above the level of the
wormwood plains, and a few withered patches of the wild
grasses among the patched bluffs, present its whole aspect.</p>

<p>The sun had nearly set before we arrived at the desired
place of encampment, the junction of the two principal
forks of Little Bear River.<a name="FNanchor_150" id="FNanchor_150"></a><a href="#Footnote_150" class="fnanchor">[150]</a> When within half a mile of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span>it, one of the trappers who had joined us, suddenly started
his horse into a quick gallop in advance of the rest of the
party. We were surprised by this sudden movement, and
hastened after him. As we rose a sharp knoll, our surprise
was changed to pleasure on seeing him in friendly converse
with a white face, a fellow-trapper, one of the "white men"
of the mountains. He was a French Canadian, fourteen
days from Brown's Hole. We were soon across the river,
and in his camp among the cotton-wood. Here we found
three others to welcome us, and give us information of the
movements of the Indians. They had been attacked by a
Sioux war party, a few days before on Little Snake River,
but had escaped {292} with no other loss than that of a hat
and a favourite dog. Their opinion was that we should
have the pleasure of meeting them on their way to Brown's
Hole. This prospect was extremely gratifying to our noble
old Kentucky guide. "D&mdash;n them," said he; "I'll try
to pick up one of the rascals. Redman was as fine a fellow
as ever came to the mountains, and they shot him
with his own rifle. He was a fool to let them have it; he
ought to have shot one of them, d&mdash;n 'em, and then died,
if he must."</p>

<p>Our elk meat was diminishing fast, under the kind
administration of our own and our friends' appetites; and
the certain prospect that we should obtain no more for eight
days was a source of no inconsiderable uneasiness to us.
And yet we gave Ward, Burns, the squaw, and the four
French trappers, being destitute of food, as freely as they
would have given to us under similar circumstances, the best
piece, and as much as they would eat for supper and breakfast.
These solitary Frenchmen were apparently very
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span>happy. Neither hunger nor thirst annoy them, so long as
they have strength to travel, and trap, and sing. Their
camps are always merry, and they cheer {293} themselves
along the weary march in the wilderness with the wild border
songs of "Old Canada." The American trappers present
a different phase of character. Habitual watchfulness
destroys every frivolity of mind and action. They
seldom smile: the expression of their countenances is watchful,
solemn, and determined. They ride and walk like
men whose breasts have so long been exposed to the bullet
and the arrow, that fear finds within them no resting-place.
If a horse is descried in the distance, they put spurs to their
animals, and are at his side at once, as the result may be,
for death or life. No delay, no second thought, no cringing
in their stirrups; but erect, firm, and with a strong arm,
they seize and overcome every danger, or "perish," as they
say, "as white men should," fighting promptly and bravely.</p>

<p>5th. This morning we were to part with Burns and
Ward, and the French trappers. The latter pursued their
way to the "Old Park," as they called the valley of Grand
River, in pursuit of beaver; the former went into the heights
in the south-west, for the same object, and the additional
one of waiting there the departure of the Sioux and Blackfeet.
These Americans had interested {294} us in themselves
by their frankness and kindness; and before leaving
them, it was pleasant to know that we could testify our
regard for them by increasing their scanty stock of ammunition.
But for every little kindness of this description, they
sought to remunerate us tenfold, by giving us moccasins,
dressed deer and elk skins, &amp;c. Every thing, even their
hunting shirts upon their backs, were at our service;&mdash;always
kindly remarking when they made an offer of such
things, that "the country was filled with skins, and they
could get a supply when they should need them."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span></p>

<p>About ten o'clock, we bade these fearless and generous fellows
a farewell as hearty and honest as any that was ever
uttered; wishing them a long and happy life in their mountain
home; and they bade us a pleasant and prosperous
journey. We took up our march again down Little Bear
River for Brown's Hole. It was six or eight "camps," or
days' travel, ahead of us; the way infested with hostile
Indians&mdash;destitute of game and grass; a horrid journey!
We might escape the Sioux; we might kill one of our horses,
and so escape death by starvation! But these few chances
of saving our lives were enough. Dangers of {295} the kind
were not so appalling to us then as they would have been
when leaving the frontier. We had been sixty odd days
among the fresh trails of hostile tribes, in hourly expectation
of hearing the war-whoop raised around us; and certain
that if attacked by a war party of the ordinary number, we
should be destroyed. We had, however, crept upon every
height which we had crossed with so much caution, and
examined the plains below with so much care, and when
danger appeared near, wound our way among the timber and
heights till we had passed it with so much success, that our sense
of danger was blunted to that degree, and our confidence in
our ability to avoid it so great, that I verily believe we thought
as little of Indians as we did of the lizards along our track.</p>

<p>We still clung to the stream. It was generally about fifty
yards wide, a rapid current, six inches deep, rushing over a
bed of loose rocks and gravel, and falling at the rate of about
two hundred feet to the mile. During the day, a grisly bear
and three cubs and an elk showed themselves. One of the
men gave chase to the bears, with the intention of killing
one of them for food; but they eluded his pursuit by running
into brush, through which a horse {296} could not penetrate
with sufficient speed to overtake them. The man in pursuit,
however, found a charming prize among the brush;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span>
a mule&mdash;an excellent pack mule, which would doubtless
be worth to him at Brown's Hole &pound;20. It was feeding
quietly, and so tame as to permit him to approach within
ten yards, without even raising its head over the hazel
bushes that partly concealed it. A double prize it was, and
so accidental; obtained at so little expense; ten minutes
time only&mdash;two pounds a minute! But alas for the &pound;20!
He was preparing to grasp it, and the mule most suddenly&mdash;most
wonderfully&mdash;most cruelly metamorphosed itself
into an elk! fat as marrow itself, and sufficient in weight to
have fed our company for twelve days. It fled away, before
our "maid and her milk pail companion" could shake his
astonished locks, and send a little lead after it, by way of
entreaty, to supply us starving wretches with a morsel of meat.</p>

<p>After this incident had imparted its comfort to our disappointed
appetites, we passed on, over, around, in, and
among deep ravines, and parched, sterile, and flinty plains
for the remainder of our ten miles' march, and encamped
on the bank of the river. The last of our meat was here
cooked and {297} eaten. A sad prospect! No game
ahead, no provisions in possession. We caught three or
four small trout from the river, for breakfast, and slept.</p>

<p>I had now become much debilitated by want of food and
the fatigues of the journey. I had appropriated my saddle
horse to bear the packs that had been borne by Kelly's
before its death; and had, consequently, been on foot ever
since that event, save when my guide could relieve me with
the use of his saddle beast. But as our Spanish servant,
the owner and myself, had only his horse's services to bear
us along, the portion to each was far from satisfying to our
exceeding weariness. Blair and Wood also, had had only
one horse from El Puebla. We were, therefore, in an ill
condition to endure a journey of seven days, over a thirsty
country, under a burning sun, and without food.</p>

<p>6th August. Eighteen miles to-day over the barren
intervales of the river. The wild wormwood and prickly
pear were almost the only evidences of vegetative powers
which the soil presented. A rugged desolation {2} of loam
and sand bluffs, barren vales of red earth, and an occasional
solitary boulder of granite; no mountains even,
to relieve the dreary monotony of the sickening sight.
About twelve o'clock it was pleasant to see a small band
of antelopes show themselves on the brink of a bluff.</p>

<p>We halted, and attempted to approach them; but they
had been hunted a few days before by the French trappers,
whom we had met, and by no means relished our companionship.
Away they ran like the wind. Our hopes of finding
game were at an end; the French trappers had seen,
on all their way out, no other game than this band of antelopes.
Our faithful greyhound could be eaten as a last
resource, and we travelled on. Our excellent guide insisted
upon walking nearly all the way that I might ride. This
was inestimably kind in him. The act flowed from his
own goodness; for, during our long journey together, he
had never failed to take every opportunity to make me
comfortable. We arranged our camp to-night with unusual
care. The Sioux were among the hills on the right,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span>
and every preparation was therefore made to receive an
attack from them. But like many other expectations of
the {3} kind, this vanished as the beautiful mountain morn
dawned upon the silent desert.</p>

<p>7th. To-day we travelled across a great southward
bend in the river.<a name="FNanchor_152" id="FNanchor_152"></a><a href="#Footnote_152" class="fnanchor">[152]</a> The face of the country a desert&mdash;neither
tree nor shrub, nor grass, nor water in sight. During
the afternoon we fell in with an old grisly bear and
two cubs. It was a dangerous business, but starvation
knows no fear.</p>

<p>Kelly and Smith, having horses that could run, determined
to give chase and shoot one cub, while the greyhound
should have the honour of a battle with the other.
Under this arrangement the chase commenced. The old
bear, unfaithful to her young, ran ahead of them in her
fright, and showed no other affection for them than to stop
occasionally, raise herself on her hind feet, and utter a
most piteous scream. The horses soon ran down one cub,
and the greyhound the other, so that in half an hour we
were on the route again with the certain prospect of a
supper when we should encamp. Had we found water and
wood where we killed our meat, we should have believed
it impossible to have proceeded further without food; but
as necessity seldom deals in mercy, she {4} compelled us in
this case, to travel till dark, before we found wood enough
to cook our food, and water enough to quench our parching
thirst. At last, turning from our track and following
down a deep ravine that ran toward the river, we came
upon a filthy, oozing sulphurous puddle which our horses,
though they had had no water the entire day, refused
to drink. There was no alternative, however, between
drinking this and thirsting still, and we submitted to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span>
lesser of two evils. We drank it; and with the aid of dry
wormwood for fuel, boiled our meat in it. These cubs
were each of about twelve pounds weight. The livers,
hearts, heads, and the fore quarters of one of them, made
us a filthy supper. It, however, served the purpose of
better food as it prevented starvation. We had travelled
eighteen miles.</p>

<p>8th. The morning being clear and excessively warm,
we thought it prudent to seek the river again, that we might
obtain water for ourselves and animals. They had had no
grass for the last twenty-four hours; and the prospect of
finding some for the poor animals upon the intervales, was
an additional inducement to adopt this course. We accordingly
wound down the ravine two {5} or three miles, struck
the river at a point where its banks were productive, and
unpacked to feed them, and treat ourselves to a breakfast
of cub meat. Boiled or roasted, it was miserable food.
To eat it, however, or not to eat at all, was the alternative.
Furthermore, in a region where lizards grow poor, and
wolves lean against sand banks to howl, cub soup, without
salt, pepper, &amp;c., must be acknowledged to be quite in
style.</p>

<p>Having become somewhat comfortable by feasting thus,
we travelled on down this river of deserts twenty miles, and
encamped again on its banks. At this encampment we ate
the last of our meat; and broke the bones with our hatchet
for the oily marrow in them. The prospect of suffering
from hunger before we could arrive at Brown's Hole,
became every hour more and more certain. The country
between us and that point was known to be so sterile, that
not even a grisly bear was to be hoped for in it. It was
a desert of black flint, sand and marl, rendered barren by
perpetual drought.</p>

<p>9th. Travelled twenty-three miles along the river&mdash;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span>nothing
to eat, not even a thistle stalk. At night we tried
to take {6} some fish; the stream proved as ungenerous as
the soil on its banks.</p>

<p>10th. Made fifteen miles to-day; country covered with
wild wormwood; at intervals a little bunch grass&mdash;dry
and dead; face of the country formerly a plain, now washed
into hills. Our dog was frantic with hunger; and although
he had treated us to a cub, and served us with all the
fidelity of his race, we determined in full council to-night,
if our hooks took no fish, to breakfast on his faithful
heart in the morning. A horrid night we passed: forty-eight
hours without a morsel of food! Our camp was
eight miles above the junction of Little Bear and Little
Snake Rivers.</p>

<p>11th. This morning we tried our utmost skill at fishing.
Patience often cried 'hold' but the appearance of
our poor dog would admonish us to continue our efforts
to obtain a breakfast from the stream. Thus we fished
and fasted till eight o'clock. A small fish or two were
caught&mdash;three or four ounces of food for seven starving
men! Our guide declared the noble dog must die! He
was accordingly shot, his hair burnt off, and his fore
quarters boiled and eaten! Some of the men declared
that dogs made excellent mutton; but on this point, there
{7} existed among us what politicians term an honest difference
of opinion. To me, it tasted like the <i>flesh of a dog</i>,
<i>a singed dog</i>; and appetite keen though it was, and edged
by a fast of fifty hours, could not but be sensibly alive to
the fact that, whether cooked or barking, a dog is still a
dog, every where. After our repast was finished, we saddled
and rode over the plains in a northerly direction for
Brown's Hole. We had been travelling the last five days,
in a westerly course; and as the river continued in that
direction, we left it to see it no more, I would humbly hope,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span>
till the dews of Heaven shall cause its deserts to blossom
and ripen into something more nutritive than wild wormwood
and gravel.</p>

<p>We crossed Little Snake River about ten o'clock. This
stream is similar in size to that we had just left.<a name="FNanchor_153" id="FNanchor_153"></a><a href="#Footnote_153" class="fnanchor">[153]</a> The
water was clear and warm; the channel rocky and bordered
by barren bluffs. No trees grew upon its banks
where we struck it; though I was informed that higher
up, it was skirted with pretty groves of cotton wood. But
as the Sioux war party which had attacked the French
trappers in this neighbourhood, was probably not far from
our trail, perhaps on it, and near us, we spent little time in
examining either groves or deserts; for {8} we were vain
enough to suppose that the mere incident of being scalped
here would not be so interesting, to ourselves at least, as
would be our speedy arrival at Craig and Thomson's post&mdash;where
we might eat Christian food and rest from the
fatigues of our journey. For these, and several other palpable
reasons, we drove on speedily and silently, with every
eye watchful, every gun well primed, every animal close
to his fellows, till ten o'clock at night. We then halted
near a place where we had been told by the French trappers,
we could find a spring of water. The day had been
excessively warm, and our thirst was well nigh insufferable.
Hence the long search for the cooling spring to
slake its burnings. It was in vain. Near midnight therefore
it was abandoned by all, and we wrapped ourselves
in our blankets, hungry, thirsty, and weary, and sunk to
rest upon the sand. Another dreadful night! Thirst,
burning thirst! The glands cease to moisten the mouth,
the throat becomes dry and feverish, the lungs cease
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span>to be satisfied with the air they inhale, the heart is
sick and faint; and the nerves preternaturally active,
do violence to every vital organ. It is an incipient throe
of death.</p>

<p>12th. We arose at break of day, and {9} pursued our
journey over the grey, barren wastes. This region is
doomed to perpetual sterility. In many portions of it
there appears to be a fine soil. But the trappers say that
very little rain or snow falls upon it; hence its unproductiveness.
And thus it is said to be with the whole country
lying to the distance of hundreds of miles on each side of
the whole course of the Colorado of the West. Vast plateaux
of desolation, yielding only the wild wormwood and
prickly pear! So barren, so hot, so destitute is it of water
that can be obtained and drunk, that the mountain sheep,
and hare even, animals which drink less than any others
that inhabit these regions, do not venture there. Travellers
along that stream are said to be compelled to carry it
long distances upon animals, and draw it where it is possible
so to do, with a rope and skin bucket from the chasm
of the stream. And yet their animals frequently die of
thirst and hunger; and men often save their lives by eating
the carcasses of the dead, and by drinking the blood
which they from time to time draw from the veins of the
living.</p>

<p>Between this river and the Great Salt Lake, there is a
stream called Severe River, which rises in the high plateaux
to the S. E. {10} of the lake, and running some considerable
distance in a westerly course, terminates in its
own lakes. On the banks of this river there is said to be some
vegetation, as grasses, trees, and edible roots. Here live the
"Piutes" and "Land Pitches," the most degraded and least
intellectual Indians known to the trappers. They wear no
clothing of any description&mdash;build no shelters. They eat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span>
roots, lizards, and snails. Their persons are more disgusting
than those of the Hottentots.<a name="FNanchor_154" id="FNanchor_154"></a><a href="#Footnote_154" class="fnanchor">[154]</a></p>

<p>They provide nothing for future wants. And when
the lizard and snail and wild roots are buried in the snows
of winter, they are said to retire to the vicinity of timber,
dig holes in the form of ovens in the steep sides of the sand
hills, and, having heated them to a certain degree, deposit
themselves in them, and sleep and fast till the weather permits
them to go abroad again for food. Persons who have
visited their haunts after a severe winter, have found the
ground around these family ovens strewn with the unburied
bodies of the dead, and others crawling among them, who
had various degrees of strength, from a bare sufficiency
to gasp in death, to those that crawled upon their hands
and feet, {11} eating grass like cattle. It is said that they
have no weapons of defence except the club, and that in the
use of that they are very unskilful. These poor creatures
are hunted in the spring of the year, when weak and
helpless, by a certain class of men, and when taken, are
fattened, carried to Santa F&eacute; and sold as slaves during
their minority. "A likely girl" in her teens brings oftentimes
&pound;60 or &pound;80. The males are valued less.</p>

<p>At about eleven o'clock we came to a stream of good
water and halted to slake our thirst and cook the remainder
of our dog mutton. Our animals' sufferings had nearly
equalled our own. And while we ate and rested under
the shade of a tree, it added much to our enjoyment to see
the famished beasts regale themselves upon a plat of short
wiry grass beside the stream. Some marks of dragging
lodge poles along the now well defined trail, indicated to
us that a portion of the Shoshonie or Snake tribe had lately<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span>
left Brown's Hole. From this circumstance we began to
fear what afterwards proved true, that our hopes of finding
the Snakes at that post and of getting meat from them
would prove fallacious. Our filthy meal being finished,
we gathered {12} up our little caravan and moved forward
at a round pace for three hours, when the bluffs opened
before us the beautiful plain of Brown's Hole.<a name="FNanchor_155" id="FNanchor_155"></a><a href="#Footnote_155" class="fnanchor">[155]</a> As we
entered it we crossed two cool streams that tumbled down
from the stratified cliffs near at hand on the right; and a
few rods beyond, the whole area became visible. The Fort,
as it is called, peered up in the centre, upon the winding
bank of the Sheetskadee. The dark mountains rose
around it sublimely, and the green fields swept away into
the deep precipitous gorges more beautifully than I can
describe.</p>

<p>How glad is man to see his home again after a weary
absence! Every step becomes quicker as he approaches
its sacred portals; and kind smiles greet him; and leaping
hearts beat upon his; and warm lips press his own.
It is the holy sacrament of friendship. Yet there is another
class of these emotions that appears to be not less holy.
They arise when, after having been long cut off from every
habit and sympathy of civilized life, long wandering among
the deep and silent temples of the eternal mountains, long
and hourly exposed to the scalping knife of savages and the
agonies of {13} starvation, one beholds the dwellings of
civilized men&mdash;kindred of the old Patriot blood, rearing
their hospitable roofs among those heights, inviting the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span>
houseless, wayworn wanderer to rest; to relax the tension
of his energies, close his long watching eyes, and
repose the heart awhile among generous spirits of his
own race. Is not the hand that grasps yours then, an
honest hand? Does it not distil, by its sacred warmth
and hearty embrace, some of the dearest emotions of which
the soul is capable; friendship unalloyed, warm, holy, and
heavenly?</p>

<p>Thus it seemed to me, at all events, as we rode into the
hollow square and received from St. Clair, the person in
charge, the hearty welcome of an old hunter to "Fort David
Crockett."<a name="FNanchor_156" id="FNanchor_156"></a><a href="#Footnote_156" class="fnanchor">[156]</a> A room was appropriated immediately for
our reception, our horses were given to the care of his horse
guard, and every other arrangement within his means,
was made, to make us feel that within that little nest of
fertility, amid the barrenness of the great Stony Range&mdash;far
from the institutions of law and religion&mdash;far from
the sweet ties of family relations, and all those nameless
endearing influences that shed their rich {14} fragrance over
human nature in its cultivated abiding places&mdash;that there
even could be given us the fruits of the sincerest friendship.
Such kindness can be appreciated fully by those
only who have enjoyed it in such places; who have seen
it manifested in its own way; by those only, who have
starved and thirsted in these deserts and been welcomed,
and made thrice welcome, after months of weary wandering,
to "Fort David Crockett."</p>

<p>After partaking of the hospitality of Mr. St. Clair, I
strolled out to examine more minutely this wonderful little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span>
valley. It is situated in or about latitude 42&deg; north; one
hundred miles south of Wind River mountains, on the
Sheetskadee (Prairie Cock) River. Its elevation is something
more than eight thousand feet above the level of the
sea. It appeared to be about six miles in diameter; shut
in, in all directions, by dark frowning mountains, rising
one thousand five hundred feet above the plain. The
Sheetskadee, or Green River, runs through it, sweeping in
a beautiful curve from the north-west to the south-west
part of it, where it breaks its way through the encircling
mountains, between cliffs, one thousand feet in height,
broken and hanging as {15} if poised on the air. The area
of the plain is thickly set with the rich mountain grasses,
and dotted with little copses of cotton wood and willow
trees. The soil is alluvial, and capable of producing
abundantly all kinds of small grains, vegetables, &amp;c.,
that are raised in the northern States. Its climate is very
remarkable. Although in all the country, within a hundred
miles of it, the winter months bring snows, and the
severe cold that we should expect in such a latitude, and
at such an elevation above the level of the sea, yet in this
little nook, the grass grows all the winter; so that, while
the storm rages on the mountains in sight, and the
drifting snows mingle in the blasts of December, the old
hunters here heed it not. Their horses are cropping the
green grass on the banks of the Sheetskadee, while they
themselves are roasting the fat loins of the mountain
sheep, and laughing at the merry tale and song.</p>

<p>The Fort is a hollow square of one story log cabins, with
roofs and floors of mud, constructed in the same manner
as those of Fort William. Around these we found the
conical skin lodges of the squaws of the white trappers,
who were away on their "fall hunt," and also the lodges
of a few {16} Snake Indians, who had preceded their tribe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span>
to this, their winter haunt. Here also were the lodges
of Mr. Robinson, a trader, who usually stations himself
here to traffic with the Indians and white trappers. His
skin lodge was his warehouse; and buffalo robes were
spread upon the ground and counter, on which he displayed
his butcher knives, hatchets, powder, lead, fish-hooks,
and whisky. In exchange for these articles he receives
beaver skins from trappers, money from travellers,
and horses from the Indians. Thus, as one would
believe, Mr. Robinson drives a very snug little business.
And indeed, when all the "independent trappers" are
driven by approaching winter into this delightful retreat,
and the whole Snake village, two or three thousand strong,
impelled by the same necessity, pitch their lodges around
the Fort, and the dances and merry makings of a long
winter are thoroughly commenced, there is no want of
customers.</p>

<p>These winters in Brown's hole are somewhat like winters
among the mountains of New England, in the effects
they produce on the rise and progress of the art of all
arts&mdash;the art of love. For, as among the good old hills
of my native clime, quiltings, {17} and singing-schools,
and evening dances, when the stars are shining brightly
on the snow crust, do soften the heart of the mountain
lad and lassie, and cause the sigh and blush to triumph
over all the counsels of maiden aunts and fortune-tellers;
so here in this beautiful valley, and in the skin lodge
village of the Snakes, there are bright evenings, beaming
stars, and mellow moons, and social circles for singing
the wild ditties of their tribe, and for sewing with the
sinews of the deer, their leggings, moccasins and buffalo
robes, and for being bewitched with the tender passion.</p>

<p>The dance, too, enlivens the village. The musician
chants the wild song, and marks the time by regular beat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</a></span>ings
with a stick upon a sounding board; and light heels,
and sturdy frames, and buxom forms respond to his call.
To these, and other gatherings, the young go, to see who
are the fairest, and best, and most loved of the throng.
Our friend Cupid goes there too. Yes, Cupid at an Indian
dance! And there measuring bow and arrow with those
who invented them, he often lays at his feet, I am told,
the proudest hawk's feather that adorns the brow of Chief
or Chiefess. For, on the {18} morning after the dance,
it not unfrequently happens that he of the beard is compelled,
by force of certain uneasy sensations about the
heart, to apply to some beardless one for the balm of sweet
smiles for his relief.</p>

<p>He does not wait for the calm hour of a Sunday night.
Nor does he delay putting the question by poetical allusions
to the violet and firmament. No! Calm hours and
the poetry of nature have no charms for him. He wants
none of these. Our friend Cupid has cast an arrow into
his heart, bearded with the stings of irresistible emotion;
and he seeks that mischievous fair one, her alone who
selected the arrow and the victim; her alone who was a
"particeps criminis" in the loss of that great central organ
of his life, called in the annals of Christian countries,
"the heart." No! his course is vastly more philosophical
and single-minded, (I mean no offence to my countrymen&mdash;none
to you, ye Britons over the waters,) than the
ginger-bread, sugar-candy courtships of Christian people.
He first pays his addresses to his band of horses;
selects the most beautiful and valuable of them all, and
then goes with his chosen horse to the lodge of his chosen
{19} girl's father or mother, or if both these be dead, to
the lodge of her eldest sister, ties the animal to the tent
pole, and goes away. After his departure, the inmates
of the lodge issue from it, and in due form examine the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</a></span>
horse, and if it appears to be worth as much as the girl
whom the owner seeks, an interview is had, the horse taken
by the parents, or sister, as the case may be, and the lover
takes the girl. A fair business transaction, you perceive,
my readers&mdash;"a quid pro quo"&mdash;a compensation in
kind.</p>

<p>The girl, received in exchange for the horse, becomes
the absolute personal property of the enamoured jockey,
subject to be re-sold whenever the state of the market
and his own affection will allow. But if those, whose
right it is to judge in the matter, are of opinion that the
girl is worth more than the horse, another is brought; and
if these are not enough, he of the beard may bring another,
or get Cupid to shoot his heart in another direction.</p>

<p>There are many benefits in this mode of obtaining that
description of legal chattels called a wife, over the mode
usually adopted among us. As for example: by this mode
there is a price given for a valuable article. Now to my
apprehension, this is an improvement upon our plan; for
it {20} removes entirely from certain old daddies, the
necessity of disposing of their daughters by gift, to certain
worthless, portionless young men, who are merely virtuous,
talented, honest and industrious; an evil of no small
magnitude, as may be learned by inquiry in the proper
quarter. But the Indian system of matrimony extirpates
it. Wealth measures off affection and property by the
peck, yard or dollar's worth, as circumstances require;
and no young lady of real genuine property, respectability
and standing, and family, will think of placing
her affections upon a talented, virtuous and industrious,
promising and prosperous coxcomb of poverty; nor, vice
vers&acirc;, will a young man of these vulgar qualities have
unfathomable barefacedness to propose himself to a young
lady of real genuine property respectability, property<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</a></span>
form, property face, property virtue, property modesty,
and property intelligence.</p>

<p>No, bless the day! such impudence will cease to interfere
with the legitimate pretensions of those who are able&mdash;while
they declare their passion mighty, unalterable
and pure&mdash;to place in the hands from which they receive
the dear object of their property love, the last quoted prices
of the family stock.</p>

<p>{21} But I pass to the consideration of another view of
this matter which I deem, if possible, of still greater importance.
As, if in disposing of young ladies in marriage,
a valuation in money should be made of their property
beauty, property modesty, property intelligence, &amp;c., and
required to be paid before marriage, the false opinion that
honesty, probity, intelligence, integrity, virtue and respectability
can exist without a property basis, would gradually
fade away before the influence of our rich daddies'
daughters. Oh the age that would then bless our earth!
The piety of the church would fan itself in the property
pew. The forum of jurisprudence would then echo to
the lofty strains of property eloquence. The groves
of Academus would breathe the wisdom of property
philosophy. The easel of the artist would cast upon
the canvas the inspirations of property genius. And
music, and sculpture, and poetry, born in garrets, would
give place to another race of these arts&mdash;a property race,
that could be kept in one's apartments without compelling
one to blush for their origin. We should then have
a property fitness of things, that would place our property
selves in a state of exalted property beatitude. {22} It is
hoped that the Legislators of the world will bestow upon
this matter their most serious attention, and from time
to time pass such laws as will aid mankind in attaining
this splendid and brilliant exaltation of our nature, when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</a></span>
the precious metals shall be a universal measure of value.</p>

<p>This is diverging. But after my reader is informed
that the only distinct aim I proposed to myself in writing
my journal, was to keep the day of the month correctly,
and in other respects "keep a blotter," the transition
from this strain of true philosophy, to a notice of the
white men and their squaws, will be thought easy and
natural.</p>

<p>If, then, a white man is disposed to take unto himself
a squaw among the Snakes, he must conform to the laws
and customs of the tribe, which have been ordained and
established for the regulation of all such matters. And,
whether the colour in any individual case be of black or
white, does not seem to be a question ever raised to take
it out of the rules. The only difference is, that the property,
beauty, &amp;c. of the whites frequently give them the
preference on 'change, and enable them to {23} obtain the
best squaws of the nation. These connexions between
the white trappers and squaws I am told, are the cause
of so many of the former remaining during life in these
valleys of blood.&mdash;They seem to love them as ardently
as they would females of their own colour.</p>

<p>A trader is living there with a young Eutaw squaw,
through whose charms he has forsaken friends, wealth
and ease, and civilization, for an Indian lodge among all
the dangers and wants of a wilderness. This gentleman
is said to have a standing offer of &pound;140 for his dear one,
whenever, in the course of a limited time, he will sell her
graces. But it is believed that his heart has so much to
do with his estimation of her value, that no consideration
could induce him voluntarily to deprive himself of
her society.</p>

<p>The above anecdotes were related to me during the
first evening I spent at Fort David Crockett. It was a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</a></span>
bright ethereal night. The Fort stood in the shade of the
wild and dark cliffs, while the light of the moon shone on
the western peaks, and cast a deeper darkness into the
inaccessible gorges on the face of the mountains. The
Sheetskadee flowed silently among the alders {24}&mdash;the
fires in the Indian lodges were smouldering; sleep had
gathered every animate thing in its embrace. It was a
night of deep solitude. I enjoyed the lovely scene till
near midnight in company with Mr. St. Clair; and when
at last its excitements and the thrilling pleasure of being
relieved from the prospect of death by hunger allowed
me to slumber, that gentleman conducted me to his own
room and bed, and bade me occupy both while I should
remain with him. He expressed regret that he had so
little provisions in the Fort;&mdash;a small quantity of old
jerked meat; a little tea and sugar.</p>

<p>"But," said he, "share it with me as long as it lasts.
I have hunters out; they will be here in ten or twelve days;
you have been starving; eat while there is any thing left,
and when all is gone we'll have a mountain sheep, or a
dog to keep off starvation till the hunters come in."</p>

<p>My companions and guide were less fortunate. We
purchased all the meat which either money or goods could
induce the Indians to sell. It amounted to one day's supply
for the company. And as there was supposed to be
no game within a circuit of one hundred miles, it became
{25} matter of serious inquiry whether we should seek it
in the direction of Fort Hall, or on the head waters of
Little Snake River, one hundred miles off our proper
route to Oregon.</p>

<p>In the latter place there were plenty of fine, fat buffalo;
but on the way to the other point there was nothing but
antelope, difficult to kill, and poor. A collateral circumstance
turned the scale of our deliberations. That cir<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</a></span>cumstance
was dog meat. We could get a supply of these
delectable animals from the Indians; they would keep
life in us till we could reach Fort Hall; and by aid thereof
we could immediately proceed on our journey, cross the
Blue Mountains before the snow should render them
impassable, and reach Vancouver, on the lower Columbia,
during the autumn. On the contrary, if we sought
meat on the waters of Little Snake River, it would be so
late before we should be prepared to resume our journey,
that we could not pass those mountains until May or June
of the following spring.</p>

<p>The dogs, therefore, were purchased; and preparations
were made for our departure to Fort Hall, as soon as
ourselves and our animals were sufficiently {26} recruited
for the undertaking. Meanwhile my companions ate
upon our stock of barking mutton. And thus we spent
seven days&mdash;delightful days; for although our fare was
humble and scanty, yet the flesh began to creep upon our
skeletons, our minds to resume their usual vivacity, and
our hearts to warm again with the ordinary emotions of
human existence.</p>

<p>The trials of a journey in the western wilderness can
never be detailed in words. To be understood, they must
be endured. Their effects upon the physical and mental
system are equally prostrating. The desolation of
one kind and another which meets the eye every where;
the sense of vastness associated with dearth and barrenness,
and of sublimity connected with eternal, killing frost;&mdash;of
loneliness coupled with a thousand natural causes
of one's destruction; perpetual journeyings over endless
declivities, among tempests, through freezing torrents;
one half the time on foot, with nothing but moccasins to
protect the feet from the flinty gravel and the thorns of
the prickly pear along the unbeaten way; and the starv<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</a></span>ings
and thirstings wilt the muscles, send preternatural
activity into the nervous system, and through the whole
{27} animal and mental economy a feebleness, an irritability
altogether indescribable.</p>

<p>At Fort David Crockett there were rest, and food, and
safety; and old Father Time, as he mowed away the passing
moments and gathered them into the great garner of
the Past, cast upon the Future a few blossoms of hope,
and sweetened the hours, now and then, with a bit of information
about this portion of his ancient dominion. I
heard from various persons, more or less acquainted with
the Colorado of the West, a confirmation of the account
of that river given in the journals of previous days; and
also that there resides at the lower end of its great kenyon,
a band of the Club Indians&mdash;very many of whom are
seven feet high, and well proportioned; that these Indians
raise large quantities of black beans upon the sandy intervales
on the stream; that the oval-leaf prickly-pear grows
there from fifteen to twenty feet in height; that these
Indians make molasses from its fruit; that their principal
weapon of warfare is the club, which they wield with
amazing dexterity and force; that they inhabit a wide
extent of country north-west, and south-east of this lower
part of the river; that they have never been subdued by
the {28} Spaniards, and are inimical to all white people.<a name="FNanchor_157" id="FNanchor_157"></a><a href="#Footnote_157" class="fnanchor">[157]</a>
Subsequent inquiry in California satisfied me that this
river is navigable only thirty or forty miles from its mouth,
and that the Indians who live upon its barren banks near
the Gulf, are such as I have described.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</a></span></p>

<p>The Snakes, or Shoshonies, are a wandering tribe of
Indians who inhabit that part of the Rocky Mountains
which lies on the Grand and Green River branches of the
Colorado of the West, the valley of Great Bear River, the
habitable shores of the Great Salt Lake, a considerable
portion of country on Snake River above and below Fort
Hall, and a tract extending two or three hundred miles
to the west of that post. Those who reside in the place
last named, are said to subsist principally on roots; they,
however, kill a few deer, and clothe themselves with their
skins. The band living on Snake River subsist on the
fish of the stream, buffalo, deer, and other game. Those
residing on the branches of the Colorado, live on roots,
buffalo, elk, deer, the mountain-sheep, and antelope. The
Snakes own many horses. These, with their thousands
of dogs, constitute all the domestic animals among them.
They have {29} conical skin-lodges, a few camp-kettles,
butcher-knives and guns. Many of them, however, still
use the bow and arrow. In dress, they follow the universal
Indian costume&mdash;moccasins, leggings, and the
hunting-shirt. Nothing but the hair covers the head; and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</a></span>this, indeed, would seem sufficient, if certain statements
made in relation to it be true; as that it frequently grows
four and five feet in length, and in one case eleven feet.
In these instances, it is braided and wound round the
head in the form of a Turkish turban. If only two or
three feet in length, it is braided on the female head in
two queues, which hang down the back: on the male, it
is only combed behind the ears, and lies dishevelled around
the shoulders. The female dress differs from that of the
male in no other respect than this: the shirt or chemise
of the former extends down to the feet. Beaver, otter,
bear and buffalo skins, and horses are exchanged by them
with the Arrapahoes, and the Americans, and British
traders, for some few articles of wearing apparel; such
as woollen blankets and hats. But as their stock of skins
is always very limited, they find it necessary to husband
it with much care, to obtain therewith a supply of tobacco,
arms and ammunition.</p>

<p>{30} From the first acquaintance of the whites with them,
these people have been remarkable for their aversion to
war, and those cruelties generally practised by their race.
If permitted to live in peace among their mountains, and
allowed to hunt the buffalo&mdash;that wandering patrimony
of all the tribes&mdash;when necessity requires, they make war
upon none, and turn none hungry away from their humble
abodes. But these peaceable dispositions in the wilderness,
where men are left to the protection of their impulses and
physical energies, have yielded them little protection. The
Blackfeet, Crows, Sioux and Eutaws have alternately fought
them for the better right to the Old Park, and portions of
their Territory, with varied success; and, at the present time,
do those tribes yearly send predatory parties into their borders
to rob them of their horses. But as the passes through
which they enter the Snake country are becoming more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</a></span>
and more destitute of game on which to subsist, their
visits are less frequent, and their number less formidable.
For several years, they have been in a great measure
relieved from these annoyances.</p>

<p>From the time they met Lewis and Clark on the head-waters
of the Missouri<a name="FNanchor_158" id="FNanchor_158"></a><a href="#Footnote_158" class="fnanchor">[158]</a> to the {31} present day, the Snakes
have opened their lodges to whites, with the most friendly
feelings. And many are the citizens of the States, and
the subjects of Britain, who have sought their villages,
and by their hospitality have been saved from death among
those awful solitudes. A guest among them is a sacred
deposit of the Great Spirit. His property, when once
arrived within their camp, is under the protection of
their honour and religious principle; and should want,
cupidity, or any other motive, tempt any individual to
disregard these laws of hospitality, the property which
may have been stolen, or its equivalent, is returned, and
the offender punished. The Snakes are a very intelligent
race. This appears in the comforts of their homes,
their well-constructed lodges, the elegance and useful form
of their wardrobes, their horse-gear, &amp;c.</p>

<p>But more especially does it exhibit itself in their views
of sensual excesses and other immoralities. These are
inhibited by immemorial usages of the tribe. Nor does
their code of customs operate upon those wrong doings
only which originate among a savage people. Whatever
indecency is offered them by their intercourse with
the {32} whites, they avoid. Civilized vice is quite as
offensive as that which grows up in their own untrained
natures. The non-use of intoxicating liquor is an example
of this kind. They abjured it from the commencement<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</a></span>
of its introduction among them. And they give
the best of reasons for this custom:&mdash;"It unmans us for
the hunt, and for defending ourselves against our enemies;
it causes unnatural dissensions among ourselves; it makes
the Chief less than his Indian; and by its use, imbecility
and ruin would come upon the Shoshonie tribe."</p>

<p>Whatever difference of opinion may exist among civilized
men on this matter, these Indians certainly reason
well for themselves, and, I am inclined to think, for all
others. A voice from the depth of the mountains&mdash;from
the lips of a savage&mdash;sends to our ears the startling
rebuke&mdash;"Make not, vend not, give not to us the
<i>strong water</i>. It prostrates your superior knowledge, your
enlarged capacities for happiness, your cultivated understandings.
It breaks your strong laws; it rots down your
strong houses; it buries you in the filthiest ditch of sin.
Send it not to us; we would rather die by the arrows of
the Blackfeet."</p>

<p>The Crows<a name="FNanchor_159" id="FNanchor_159"></a><a href="#Footnote_159" class="fnanchor">[159]</a> are a wandering tribe, and {33} usually
found in the upper plains around the head-waters of the
north fork of Great Platte, Snake, and Yellowstone rivers.
Their number is estimated to be about five thousand.
They are represented as the most arrant rascals among
the mountains. The traders say of them that "they have
never been known to keep a promise or do an honourable
act." No white man or Indian trusts them. Murder
and robbery are their principal employments. Much
of their country is well watered, timbered, and capable of
yielding an abundant reward to the husbandman.</p>

<p>The Blackfeet Indians reside on the Marias and other
branches of the Missouri above the Great Falls. In 1828
they numbered about two thousand five hundred lodges<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</a></span>
or families. During that year they stole a blanket from
the American Fur Company's steamboat on the Yellowstone,
which had belonged to a man who had died of the
small-pox on the passage up the Missouri. The infected
article being carried to their encampment upon the "left
hand fork of the Missouri," spread the dreadful infection
among the whole tribe. They were amazed at the
appearance of the disease. The red blotch, the bile, congestion
of the lungs, {34} liver, and brain, were all new to
their medicine-men; and the rotten corpse falling in pieces
while they buried it, struck horror into every heart. In
their frenzy and ignorance they increased the number
of their sweat ovens upon the banks of the stream, and
whether the burning fever or the want of nervous action
prevailed; whether frantic with pain, or tottering in death,
they were placed in them, sweated profusely and plunged
into the snowy waters of the river. The mortality which
followed this treatment was a parallel of the Plague in
London. They endeavoured for a time to bury the dead,
but these were soon more numerous than the living. The
evil-minded medicine-men of all ages had come in a body
from the world of spirits, had entered into them, and were
working the annihilation of the Blackfeet race.</p>

<p>The Great Spirit had also placed the floods of his
displeasure between himself and them. He had cast a
mist over the eyes of their conjurors, that they might not
know the remedial incantation. Their hunts were ended;
their bows were broken; the fire in the Great Pipe was
extinguished for ever; their graves called for them; and
the call was now answered by a thousand dying {35}
groans. Mad with superstition and fear, brother forsook
sister; father his son; and mother her sucking child; and
fled to the elevated vales among the western heights, where
the influences of the climate, operating upon the already<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</a></span>
well-spent energies of the disease, restored the remainder
of the tribe again to health. Of the two thousand five
hundred families existing at the time the pestilence commenced,
one or more members of eight hundred only survived
its ravages; and even to this hour do the bones of
seven or eight thousand Blackfeet lie unburied among
the decaying lodges of their deserted village, on the banks
of the Yellowstone. But this infliction has in no wise
humanized their blood-thirsty nature. As ever before,
they wage exterminating war upon the traders and trappers,
and the Oregon Indians.<a name="FNanchor_160" id="FNanchor_160"></a><a href="#Footnote_160" class="fnanchor">[160]</a></p>

<p>The Arrapahoes reside south of the Snakes.<a name="FNanchor_161" id="FNanchor_161"></a><a href="#Footnote_161" class="fnanchor">[161]</a> They
wander in the winter season over the country about the
head of the Great Kenyon of the Colorado of the West,
and to a considerable distance down that river; and in
summer hunt the buffalo in the New Park, or "Bull Pen,"
in the "Old Park" on Grand River, and in "Boyou
Salade," on the south fork of the Platte. Their {36}
number is not well ascertained. Some estimate it at three
thousand, others more, and others still less. They are
said to be a brave, fearless, thrifty, ingenious, and hospitable
people. They own large numbers of horses,
mules, dogs, and sheep. The dogs they fatten and eat.
Hence the name Arrapahoes&mdash;dog eaters. They manufacture
the wool of their sheep into blankets of a very
superior quality. I saw many of them; possessed one;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</a></span>and believe them to be made with something in the form
of a darning-needle. They appeared to be wrought, in
the first time, like a fishing-net; and on this, as a foundation,
darned so densely that the rain will not penetrate them.
They are usually striped or checked with yellow and red.</p>

<p>There is in this tribe a very curious law of naturalization;
it is based upon property. Any one, whether red
or white, may avail himself of it. One horse, which can
run with sufficient speed to overtake a buffalo cow, and
another horse or mule, capable of bearing a pack of two
hundred pounds, must be possessed by the applicant.</p>

<p>These being delivered to the principal chief of the tribe,
and his intentions being made known, he is declared a
citizen of the {37} Arrapahoe tribe, and entitled to a wife
and other high privileges thereunto appertaining. Thus
recognized, he enters upon a life of savage independence.
His wife takes care of his horses, manufactures his saddles
and bridles, and leash ropes and whips, his moccasins,
leggings, and hunting-shirts, from leather and
other materials prepared by her own hands; beats with a
wooden adze his buffalo robes, till they are soft and
pleasant for his couch; tans hides for his tent covering,
and drags from the distant hills the clean white-pine poles
to support it; cooks his daily food and places it before
him. And should sickness overtake him, and death rap
at the door of his lodge, his squaw watches kindly the last
yearnings of the departing spirit. His sole duty, as her
lord in life, and as a citizen of the Arrapahoe tribe, is to
ride the horse which she saddles and brings to his tent,
kill the game which she dresses and cures; sit and
slumber on the couch which she spreads; and fight the enemies
of the tribe. Their language is said to be essentially
the same as that spoken by the Snakes and Cumanches.<a name="FNanchor_162" id="FNanchor_162"></a><a href="#Footnote_162" class="fnanchor">[162]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</a></span></p>

<p>This, and other tribes in the mountains, and in the upper
plains, have a custom, the {38} same in its objects as was
the ceremony of the "toga virilis" among the Romans.</p>

<p>When ripened into manhood, every young man of the
tribe is expected to do some act of bravery that will give
promise of his disposition and ability to defend the rights
of his tribe and family. Nor can this expectation be disregarded.
So, in the spring of the year, those of the age
alluded to, associate themselves forty or fifty in a band,
and devote themselves to the duties of man's estate in the
following manner:&mdash;They take leave of their friends,
and depart to some secret place near the woodlands;
collect poles twenty or thirty feet in length, and raise them
in the form of a cone; and cover the structure so thickly
with leaves and boughs as to secure the interior from the
gaze of persons outside. They then hang a fresh buffalo's
head inside, near the top of the lodge where the poles meet;
and below this, around the sides, suspend camp-kettles,
scalps, and blankets, and the skin of a white buffalo, as
offerings to the Great Spirit. After the lodge is thus
arranged, they enter it with much solemnity, and commence
the ceremonies which are to consecrate themselves
to war, and the destruction of their own enemies, and
those of the tribe. The {39} first act, is to seat themselves
in a circle round a fire built in the centre of the lodge, and
"make medicine;" that is,&mdash;invoke the presence and
aid of protecting spirits, by smoking the great mystic pipe.</p>

<p>One of their number fills it with tobacco and herbs,
places upon the bowl a bright coal from the fire within
the lodge, draws the smoke into his lungs, and blows it
thence through his nostrils. He then seizes the stem with
both hands, and leaning forward, touches the ground
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</a></span>between his feet with the lower part of the bowl, and
smokes again as before. The feet, and arms, and breast,
are successively touched in a similar way; and after each
touching, the sacred smoke is inhaled as before. The
pipe is then passed to the one on his right, who smokes
as his fellow has done. And thus the Great Pipe goes
round, and the smoke rises and mingles with the votive
offerings to the Great Spirit which are suspended above
their heads. Immediately after this smoking is believed
to be a favoured time for offering prayer to the Great Spirit.
They pray for courage, and victory over their foes in the
campaign they are about to undertake; and that they
may be protected from the spirits of evil-minded medicine
men. They then make a solemn and irrevocable
vow, that if {40} these medicine men do not make them
sick&mdash;do not enter into their bosoms and destroy their
strength and courage, they will never again see their relatives
and tribe, unless they do so in garments stained with
the blood of their enemies.</p>

<p>Having passed through these ceremonies, they rise and
dance to the music of a war chant, till they are exhausted
and swoon. In this state of insensibility, they imagine
that the spirits of the brave dead visit them and teach
them their duty, and inform them of the events that will
transpire during the campaign. Three days and nights
are passed in performing these ceremonies; during which
time, they neither eat nor drink, nor leave the lodge. At
early dawn of the fourth day they select a leader from
their number, appoint a distant place of meeting; and
emerging from the lodge, each walks away from it alone
to the place of rendezvous. Having arrived there, they
determine whose horses are to be stolen, whose scalps
taken, and commence their march. They always go out
on foot, wholly dependent upon their own energies for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</a></span>
food and every other necessary. Among other things,
it is considered a great disgrace to be long without meat
and the means of riding.</p>

<p>It sometimes happens that these parties {41} are unable
to satisfy the conditions of their consecration during the
first season; and therefore are compelled to resort to some
ingenious and satisfactory evasion of the obligations of
their vow, or to go into winter quarters till another opening
spring allows them to prosecute their designs. The
trappers relate a case of this kind, which led to a curious
incident. A war party of Blackfeet had spent the season
in seeking for their enemies without success. The storms
of approaching winter had begun to howl around, and
a wish to return to the log fires and buffalo meat, and
hilarities and friendships of the camp of the tribe in the
high vales of the Upper Missouri, had become ardent,
when a forlorn, solitary trapper who had long resided
among them, entered their camp. Affectionate and sincere
greetings passed at the moment of meeting.</p>

<p>The trapper, as is the custom, was invited to eat; and
all appeared friendly and glad. But soon the Indians
became reserved, and whispered ominously among themselves.
At length came to the ear of the trapper high
words of debate in regard to his life. They all agreed
that his white skin indubitably indicated that he belonged
to the "Great Tribe" of their natural enemies, and that
{42} with the blood of a white upon their garments, they
would have fulfilled the terms of their vow, and could
return to their friends and tribe. A part of them seriously
questioned whether the sacred names of friend and
brother, which they had for years applied to him, had not
so changed his natural relationship to them, that the Great
Spirit, to whom they had made their vow, had sent him
among them in the character which they themselves had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</a></span>
given him&mdash;as a friend and brother. If so, they reasoned
that the sacrifice of his life would only anger Him, and
by no means relieve them from the obligations of their
vow.</p>

<p>Another party reasoned that the Great Spirit had sent
this victim among them to test their fidelity to Him. He
had indeed been their friend; they had called him brother,
but he was also their natural enemy; and that the Great
One to whom they had made their vow, would not release
them at all from its obligations, if they allowed this factitious
relation of friendship to interfere with obedience
to Himself. The other party rejoined, that although
the trapper was their natural enemy, he was not one
within the meaning of their vow; that the taking of
his life would be an evasion of its sacred {43} obligations,
a blot upon their courage, and an outrage upon the
laws of friendship; that they could find other victims, but
that their friend could not find another life. The other
party rebutted, that the trapper was confessedly their natural
enemy; that the conditions of their vow required the
blood of their natural enemy; and that the Great Spirit
had sufficiently shown His views of the relative obligations
of friendship and obedience to Himself in sending the
trapper to their camp.</p>

<p>The trapper's friends perceiving that the obstinacy of
their opponents was unlikely to yield to reason, proposed
as a compromise, that, since, if they should adjudge the
trapper their enemy within the requirements of their vow,
his blood only would be needed to stain their garments,
they would agree to take from him so much as might be
necessary for that purpose; and that in consideration of
being a brother, he should retain enough to keep his heart
alive. As their return to their tribe would be secured by
this measure, little objection was raised to it. The flint<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</a></span>
lancet was applied to the veins of the white man; their
garments were dyed with his blood; they departed for
their nation's village, and the poor trapper for the beaver
among the hills.</p>

<p>{44} My worthy old guide, Kelly, had often seen these
medicine lodges. He informed me that many of the votive
offerings, before mentioned, are permitted to decay with
the lodge in which they are hung; that the penalty to any
mortal who should dare appropriate them to his use was
death. A certain white man, however, who had been
robbed of his blanket at the setting in of winter, came upon
one of these sacred lodges, erected by the young Arrapahoes
which contained, among other things, a blanket that
seemed well calculated to shield him from the cold. He
spread it over his shivering frame, and very unadvisedly
went into the Arrapahoe village. The Indians knew the
sacred deposit, held a council, called the culprit before
them, and demanded why he had stolen from the Great
Spirit? In exculpation, he stated that he had been
robbed; that the Great Spirit saw him naked in the
wintry wind; pitied him; showed him the sacred lodge,
and bade him take the blanket. "That seems to be well,"
said the principal chief to his fellow-counsellors. "The
Great Spirit has an undoubted right to give away his own
property;" and the trader was released.</p>

<p>Among the several personages whom I {45} chanced to
meet at Brown's Hole, was an old Snake Indian, who saw
Messrs. Lewis and Clark on the head-waters of the Missouri
in 1805. He is the individual of his tribe, who first
saw the explorers' cavalcade. He appears to have been
galloping from place to place in the office of sentinel to
the Shoshonie camp, when he suddenly found himself in
the very presence of the whites. Astonishment fixed him
to the spot. Men with faces pale as ashes, had never been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</a></span>
seen by himself or nation. "The head rose high and
round, the top flat; it jutted over the eyes in a thin rim;
their skin was loose and flowing, and of various colours."
His fears at length overcoming his curiosity, he fled in
the direction of the Indian encampment; but being seen
by the whites, they pursued and brought him to their
camp; exhibited to him the effects of their fire-arms,
loaded him with presents, and let him go. Having arrived
among his own people, he told them he had seen men with
faces pale as ashes, who were makers of thunder, lightning,
etc. This information astounded the whole tribe.
They had lived many years, and their ancestors had lived
many more, and there were many legends which spoke of
many wonderful {46} things; but a tale like this they
never had heard.</p>

<p>A council was, therefore, assembled to consider the
matter. The man of strange words was summoned
before it, and he rehearsed, in substance, what he had
before told to others, but was not believed. "All men
were red, and therefore he could not have seen men as
pale as ashes." "The Great Spirit made the thunder
and the lightning; he therefore could not have seen men
of any colour that could produce these. He had seen
nothing; he had lied to his chief, and should die."</p>

<p>At this stage of the proceedings, the culprit produced
some of the presents which he had received from the pale
men. These being quite as new to them as pale faces
were, it was determined "that he should have the privilege
of leading his judges to the place where he declared
he had seen these strange people; and if such were found
there, he should be exculpated; if not, these presents
were to be considered as conclusive evidence against him,
that he dealt with evil spirits, and that he was worthy of
death by the arrows of his kinsfolks." The pale men,
the thunder-makers, were found, and were witnesses of
{47} the poor fellow's story. He was released; and has
ever since been much honoured and loved by his tribe,
and every white man in the mountains.<a name="FNanchor_163" id="FNanchor_163"></a><a href="#Footnote_163" class="fnanchor">[163]</a> He is now
about eighty years old, and poor. But as he is always
about Fort David Crockett, he is never permitted to want.</p>

of Colorado, on Green River. It is thought to have been named for an early trapper.
The valley, which is about thirty miles long by five or six in width, is formed
by an expansion of the ca&ntilde;on walls of the river, so that all about it cliffs rise to a
great height. The only entrance is a rocky chasm at the east, about sixty yards
wide. The valley is so sheltered that it possesses an unusual climate, with seldom
snow enough to cover the pasturage; it was, therefore, a favorite wintering ground
for trappers and hunters.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p></div>

that the distance from any well-worn route of travel and the lack of game on the

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_157" id="Footnote_157"></a><a href="#FNanchor_157"><span class="label">[157]</span></a> Farnham refers here to tribes of the Yuman stock; see our volume xviii,
p. 131, note 65. The Yuma proper are large physically, and finely proportioned.
A recent writer declares that their men are nearly all over six feet in height&mdash;see
Eugene J. Trippel, "Yuma Indians," in <i>Overland Monthly</i>, xiii, xiv. They are
an agricultural people and depend largely upon the mesquite harvest, which Farnham
refers to as black beans. The Yuma were made known to the Spaniards by
the reports of the Franciscan padre, Francisco Garc&eacute;s, who in 1771 visited them
from his mission on the Gila. They received him with joy, and begged for his
return; he revisited them in 1774. Shortly after this a Yuman chief called Palma
was conveyed to Mexico. Awed by what he saw, he consented to baptism, and
requested a mission in his own land. But it was not until 1779 that the foundation
of a mission was laid, and in the following year two small colonies were begun&mdash;one
on the site of Fort Yuma, and the other eight miles lower down. The
natives, however, found their new neighbors troublesome and exacting, and rising
in revolt July 17, 1781, with clubs massacred almost the entire garrison, including
four missionary padres; see Coues, <i>Francisco Garc&eacute;s</i>, i, pp. 10-24. Hence the
appellation, "Club Indians." In 1857 the Yuma suffered a severe defeat from
their neighbors, the Pima and Maricopa, wherein over a third of their warriors
perished. They have generally been on friendly terms with the United States
government, which has recently arranged a system of irrigation for their lands.
About fifty-six Yuma still live on their reservation, and have a reputation for industry
beyond that of most tribesmen; see U. S. Indian Commissioner's <i>Report</i>, 1904,

<p>17th. An event of great interest occurred this day. It
was the arrival of Paul Richardson and three of his companions
from Fort Hall. This old Yankee woodsman
had been upon one of his favourite summer trips from St.
Louis to the borders of Oregon. He had acted as guide
and hunter to a party of missionaries to the Oregon Indians.
{49} Several other persons from the western states had
accompanied them: one with the lofty intention of conquering
California; and others with the intention of trading,
farming, &amp;c., on the lower Columbia; and others
to explore the Rocky Mountains, and the wonders of nature
along the shores of the Pacific.<a name="FNanchor_164" id="FNanchor_164"></a><a href="#Footnote_164" class="fnanchor">[164]</a> The events of their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</a></span>tour were freely discussed. They had storms of hail and
human wrath. The conqueror of California had been
disposed to act the general before he had received his
epaulettes; had proved to be so troublesome that he was
expelled from camp a short distance from the frontier,
and obliged to ride, sleep, and eat, at a comfortable distance
from his companions, during the remainder of the
journey.</p>

<p>The missionaries, too, Messrs. Monger and Griffith,<a name="FNanchor_165" id="FNanchor_165"></a><a href="#Footnote_165" class="fnanchor">[165]</a>
and their ladies, had had causes of irritability; so that
between all the conflicting feelings and opinions of the
party, their little camp, it was said, was frequently full
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</a></span>of trouble. Oregon also came under discussion. Mr.
Richardson had travelled over the territory; knew it well;
it was not so productive as New England; fifteen bushels
of wheat to the acre was an extraordinary crop; corn and
{50} potatoes did not yield the seed planted; rain fell
incessantly five months of the year; the remainder was
unblessed even with dew; the Indians and whites residing
there had the fever and ague, or bilious fever, the year
through; that what little of human life was left by these
causes of destruction, was consumed by musquitoes and
fleas; that the Columbia river was unfit for navigation&mdash;fit
only for an Indian fish-pond. Such a description of
Oregon (the part of the American domain represented
by traders, trappers, and travellers, as most delightful,
beautiful, and productive) was astonishing, unlooked-for,
and discouraging. And did I not recollect that Mr. Richardson
had reasons for desiring to increase the strength
of his party through the dangerous plains towards the
States, I should, after having seen Oregon, be at a loss to
divine the purpose of such a representation of it.</p>

<p>18th. Mr. Richardson's description of Oregon had the
effect of drawing off two of my companions. They had no
evidence to oppose to his account; he had resided two
years in the Territory, and on the knowledge acquired by
that means, had represented it to be in no sense a desirable
place of abode. They therefore forsook the chase
after a {51} desert, and joined him for the green glades of
the valley States. On the morning of the 18th, they left
me. It was the most disheartening event which had
befallen me on the journey. Oakley and Wood had stood
by me in the trials and storms of the plains; had evinced
a firmness of purpose equal to every emergency that had
occurred, were men on whom reliance could be placed;
humane men, always ready to do their duty promptly and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</a></span>
cheerfully. It was painful therefore to part with them
at a time when their services were most needed. Alone
in the heart of the Rocky Mountains, a traveller through
the range of the Blackfeet war parties, in bad health, no
men save poor old Blair, and the worse than useless vagabond
Smith, alias Carroll, to aid me in resisting these
savages: I felt alone.</p>

<p>I was indeed kindly offered quarters for the winter at
Brown's Hole; but if I accepted them, I should find it
impossible to return to the States the next year. I determined
therefore to reach the Columbia river that season,
be the risk and manner what it might. Accordingly I
engaged a Snake Indian, whom the whites called "Jim,"
to pilot me to Fort Hall, the march to commence on the
morning of the 19th&mdash;distance two {52} hundred miles,
compensation fifty loads of ammunition, and three bunches
of beads.</p>

<p>There is in this valley, and in some other parts of the
mountains, a fruit called bulberry.<a name="FNanchor_166" id="FNanchor_166"></a><a href="#Footnote_166" class="fnanchor">[166]</a> It is the most
delightful acid in the vegetable kingdom; of the size of
the common red currant, with larger seeds than are found
in that fruit; colour deep red. It grows upon bushes
eight or ten feet high, which in general appearance resemble
a young beech tree. Of these berries I obtained a
small quantity, had a dog butchered, took a pound or two
of dried buffalo meat which Mr. St. Clair kindly gave me,
purchased a horse of Mr. Robinson for the use of Blair,
and on the morning of the 19th of August left the hospitalities
of Fort David Crockett for the dreary waste and
starving plains between it and Fort Hall. Blair, Smith,
and my guide Jim, constituted my whole force. Numerous
war-parties of Blackfeet and Sioux were hovering
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</a></span>over my trail. If discovered by them, death was certain;
if not, and starvation did not assail us, we might reach
the waters of Snake river. At all events the trial was to
be made; and at ten o'clock, <span class="smcap">A. M.</span>, we were winding our
way up the Sheetskadee.</p>

<p>Of the regrets at leaving this beautiful {53} little valley,
there was no one that I remember more vividly than that
of parting with my old guide. Kelly was a man of many
excellent qualities. He was brave without ostentation,
kind without making you feel an obligation; and preferred
on all occasions the happiness of others to his own
ease or safety. The river during the twelve miles' travel
of the day, appeared to be about one hundred yards wide,
a rapid current two feet deep, water limpid. The mountains
on either side rose half a mile from the river in dark
stratified masses, one thousand feet above the level of the
stream. On their sides were a few shrub cedars. The
lower hills were covered with the hated wild wormwood
and prickly pear. The banks were of white clay, alternated
with the loose light coloured sandy soil of the mountain
districts. The rocks were quartz, red sand-stone,
and limestone. Our camp was pitched at night on the
high bank of the stream among the bushes; and a supper
of stewed dog-meat prepared us for sleep.</p>

<p>20th. At seven o'clock in the morning we had breakfasted
and were on our way. We travelled three miles
up the east bank of the river, and came to a mountain,
through which it broke its way with a noise which indicated
the fall to be great, and the {54} channel to be a deep
rugged chasm.<a name="FNanchor_167" id="FNanchor_167"></a><a href="#Footnote_167" class="fnanchor">[167]</a> Near the place where it leaves the
chasm, we turned to the right, and followed up a rough,
deep gorge, the distance of five miles, and emerged into
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</a></span>a plain. This gorge had been formed by the action of a
tributary of Green River, upon the soft red sand-stone
that formed the precipices around. It winds in the distance
of five miles to every point of the compass. Along
much of its course also the cliffs hang over the stream in
such a manner as to render it impossible to travel the water-side.
Hence the necessity, in ascending the gorge, of
clambering over immense precipices, along brinks of
yawning caverns, on paths twelve or fourteen inches in
width, with not a bush to cling to in the event of a false
step. And yet our Indian horses were so well used to
passes of the kind, that they travelled them without fear
or accident till the worst were behind us.</p>

<p>How delusive the past as a test of the future! I was
felicitating myself upon our good fortune, as the caravan
wound its way slowly over a sharp cliff before me, when
the shout from the men in advance, "Well done, Puebla,"
made me hasten to the top of the ridge. My Puebla mare
had left the track. Instead of following a wide, {55}
well-beaten way down the mountain, she in her wisdom
had chosen to tread the shelf of a cliff, which, wide at the
place where it sprang from the pathway, gradually became
narrower, till it was lost in the perpendicular face of the
mountain. She was under a high bulky back at the time,
and before she had quite explored the nethermost inch
of the interesting stratum which she was disposed to trace
to its lowest dip, the centre of gravity was suddenly thrown
without the base, and over she reeled, and fell ten or
twelve feet among broken rocks, then rolled and tumbled
six hundred feet more of short perpendicular descents
and inclined plains, into the stream below. On descending
and examining her, I found her horribly mangled,
the blood running from the nostrils, ears, and other parts
of the body. As it was apparent she would soon die, I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</a></span>
stripped her of her packs and gear, drove her to a plat
of grass where she could find food, should she need it,
and left her to her fate.</p>

<p>This accident being disposed of, we emerged from this
gorge, travelled over barren gravelly plains, dotted with
pyramidal hills of the same material, whose {56} sides
were belted with strata of coarse grey sand-stone. About
four o'clock <span class="smcap">P. M.</span>, Jim halted beside a little brook, and
pointing ahead, said, "Wat, ugh, u&mdash;gh;" by which I
understood that the next water on our way was too far
distant to be reached that night; and we encamped.
The scenery to the west was very beautiful. A hundred
rods from our camp, in that direction, rose an apparently
perfect pyramid of regular stratified black rocks, about
six hundred feet in height, with a basilar diameter of
about eight hundred feet, and partially covered with
bushes. Beyond it, some five hundred yards, crept away
a circling ridge of the same kind of rocks, leaving a beautiful
lawn between. And still beyond, sixty miles to the
south-west, through a break in the hills that lay in clusters
over the intervening country, a portion of the Anahuac
range was seen, sweeping away in the direction of
the Great Salt Lake.</p>

<p>Jim had turned his horse loose as soon as he saw we were
disposed to encamp according to his wishes, and was away
with his rifle to the hills. In an instant he was on their
heights, creeping stealthily among the bushes and rocks;
and the crack of {57} his rifle, and the tumbling of some
kind of game over the cliffs, immediately succeeded.
More nimble and sure of step than the mountain goat,
he sprang down again from cliff to cliff, reached the plain,
and the next moment was in camp, crying "hos, ugh, yes."
I sent my horse and brought in his game; a noble buck
antelope, of about forty pounds weight. In consequence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</a></span>
of this windfall, our dog meat was thrown among the willows
for the behoof of the wolves. My guide, poor fellow,
had eaten nothing since we left the Fort. His tribe have
a superstition of some kind which forbids them the use
of such meat. A dog-eater is a term of reproach among
them. If one of their number incurs the displeasure of
another, he is called "Arrapahoe," the name of the tribe
previously described, who fatten these animals for some
great annual feast. Jim's creed, however, raised no
objections to the flesh of the antelope. He ate enormously,
washed himself neatly, combed his long dark hair,
pulled out his beard with his right thumb and left forefinger
nails, and "turned in."</p>

<p>21st. Twenty miles to-day. The ride of the forenoon
was over plains and hills of coarse gravel, destitute
of grass, timber, {58} or brush, the everywhere present
wild wormwood excepted; that of the afternoon was
among broken hills, alternately of gravel and brown sand,
here and there dotted with a tuft of bunch grass. From
some few of the hills protruded strata of beautiful slate.
The bottom lands of the river, even, were as barren as
Sahara. The only living things seen, were the small prairie
wolf, and flocks of magpie. This bird inhabits the most
dreary portions of the mountains, and seems to delight in
making the parched and silent deserts more lonely by its
ominous croak of welcome to its desolate habitation.</p>

<p>The raven indeed was about us, throwing his funeral
wing upon the light of the setting sun. In fine, to-day,
as often before, I found nothing in nature from which to
derive a single pulse of pleasure, save the vastness of desolate
wastes, the tombs of the washing of the flood!
Towards night, however, we were gratified by finding a
few decrepid old cotton-wood trees, on the bank of the
Sheetskadee, among which to encamp. Our horses hav<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</a></span>ing
had little food for the last forty-eight hours, devoured
with eager appetite the dry grass along the banks. Since
{59} leaving Brown's Hole, our course had been nearly
due north.</p>

<p>22nd. Travelled up Green River about three miles,
crossed it three times, and took to the hills on its western
side. The course of the river, as far as seen in this valley,
is nearly south; the bottom and banks generally of
gravel; the face of the country a dry, barren, undulating
plain.<a name="FNanchor_168" id="FNanchor_168"></a><a href="#Footnote_168" class="fnanchor">[168]</a> Our course, after leaving the river, was
north-west by north. About two o'clock, we struck
Ham's Fork, a tributary of Green River, and encamped
near the water-side.<a name="FNanchor_169" id="FNanchor_169"></a><a href="#Footnote_169" class="fnanchor">[169]</a> This stream probably pours down
immense bodies of water when the snow melts upon the
neighbouring highlands; for its channel, at the place
where we struck it, was half a mile in width, and two
hundred feet deep. Very little water is said to run in it
during July, August and September. The current was
three or four inches in depth, a rod wide, and sluggish.
Three butes appeared in the north-east, about twelve
o'clock, fifteen miles distant. One of them resembled a
vast church, surmounted by a perpendicular shaft of
rock, probably three hundred feet in height. The swelling
base resembled in colour the sands of this region. The
rock shaft was dark, probably basalt.</p>

<p>{60} By the side of this, springing immediately from
the plain, rose another shaft of rock, about one hundred
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</a></span>and fifty feet high, of regular outline, and about fifteen
feet in diameter. Seven or eight miles to the north, rose
another bute, a perpendicular shaft, fifty or sixty feet in
height, resting upon a base of hills which rise about three
hundred feet above the plain. Beyond these butes, to
the east, the country seemed to be an open plain. To the
south of them extends a range of dark mountains, reaching
far into the dimly-discerned neighbourhood of Long's
Peak.<a name="FNanchor_170" id="FNanchor_170"></a><a href="#Footnote_170" class="fnanchor">[170]</a> The whole circle of vision presented no other
means of life for man or beast than a few small patches
of dry grass, and the water of the stream. Many of the
sandy bluffs were covered with the prickly pear and wild
wormwood. Generally, however, nothing green, nothing
but the burnt, unproductive waste appeared, which no
art of man can reclaim. Yet far in the north, the snowy
peaks of Wind River Mountains, and to the south-west,
a portion of the Anahuac ridge indicated that it might
be possible to find along the borders of this great grave of
vegetation, green vales and purling brooks to alleviate the
desolation of the scene.</p>

<p>We travelled fifteen miles to-day, and {61} encamped
upon the bank of the stream; cooked supper, and wrapping
ourselves in our blankets, with saddles for pillows,
and curtained by the starry firmament, slept sweetly among
the overhanging willows. Near midnight, the light of
the moon aroused me. It was a lovely night. The stars
seemed smaller than they do in less elevated situations,
but not less beautiful. For, although they are not so brilliant,
they burn steadily, brightly on the hours of night
in these magnificent wastes. It was midnight. The wolves
are correct time-keepers.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</a></span></p>
<p>I had scarcely viewed the delightful scene around me,
when these sleepless sentinels of the deserts raised their
midnight howl. It rung along the chambers of the mountains,
was, at intervals, taken up by kennel after kennel,
till, in the deep and distant vales, it yielded again to the
all-pervading silence of night. This is one of the habits
that instinct has taught their race. As soon as the first
light of morning appears in the east, they raise a <i>reveille</i>
howl in the prairies of the Western States which, keeping
company with the hours, swells along the vast plains from
Texas to the sources of the Mississippi, and from Missouri
to the depths of the Rocky Mountains. All day
{62} they lurk in silence. At midnight, another howl
awakens the sleeping wilderness&mdash;more horrible and
prolonged; and it is remarkable with what exactness they
hit the hour.</p>

<p>23rd. We were up this morning before the light; and
while the sun rose in the Great Gap, mounted our jaded
horses for the day's ride. As we moved onward upon
the elevated bluffs which border the river, the light of the
morning showed the butes clearly on the eastern horizon.
Jim paid little regard to the course of the stream to-day;
but struck a bee line for some object, unseen by us, across
the hills&mdash;at times among wild wormwood, at others
among sharp, flinty stones, so thickly laid over the ground
that none but an Indian horse would travel over them.
We occasionally approached the stream, and were gratified
with the appearance of a few solitary old cotton-wood
trees on its banks. A poor, stinted shrub willow, too,
made great effort here and there to prolong existence, but
with little success. Even in one little nook, the wild rose,
currant, and bulberry bushes had the effrontery to bear
leaves.</p>

<p>About four o'clock, <span class="smcap">P. M.</span>, small patches of dry grass were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</a></span>
seen in the ravines. On one {63} of these were five buffalo;
but they proved to us more delightful to the sight than to
any other sense, since I was unable to induce my guide
to halt and hunt them. This apparently unpardonable
stubbornness was afterward explained. He had the only
animal which could run fast enough to approach them&mdash;he
alone could ride him&mdash;and having lost his right
thumb, protested that he could not discharge his piece from
a running horse. But having no interpreter with us to
render his furious protestations intelligible, I attributed his
unwillingness to lay in a supply of good meat here to mere
malicious indifference. At five o'clock, we came upon
a plat of excellent grass, around a clump of yellow pines.
Near this, weary and hungry, we made our camp for the
night; ate the half of the meat in our possession&mdash;a mere
mite&mdash;and gorged ourselves with wild currants, which
grew plentifully among the pines, until the darkness bade
us cease. Course as yesterday: the butes out of sight
during the afternoon. We supposed we had travelled
twenty miles; weather exceedingly warm.</p>

<p>24th. Rode on a fast trot till about three o'clock, <span class="smcap">P. M.</span>,
made about twenty-five miles. Our route lay over sandy
and gravelly {64} swells, and the bottom lands of Ham's
Fork; the latter, like the former, were well nigh destitute
of vegetation.<a name="FNanchor_171" id="FNanchor_171"></a><a href="#Footnote_171" class="fnanchor">[171]</a> When about to encamp, we had the
excellent fortune to espy an antelope on a bluff hard by.
He fell before the well levelled rifle of our one-thumbed
guide. A fat one he was too; just such an one as the
imaginations of our hungry stomachs had all the day been
figuring to themselves would afford a pleasant variety in
the matter of starvation. The circle of vision, the last day
or two, had been very much circumscribed by the increasing
size of the undulating bluffs, among which our way
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</a></span>usually ran. And from their tops, whenever we chanced
to go over them, neither the Wind River Mountains nor
the Anahuac range were visible. In all directions, to the
limit of sight, rolled away the dead, leafless, thirsty swells.
Wolves and ravens live among them; but whence they
derive subsistence is a difficult problem even for themselves
to solve. Their howlings and croakings evidently
came from famished mouths.</p>

<p>25th. Fifteen miles to-day along the river; course as
on the 24th, N. W. by W., among the bluffs that border
the stream; or if that were tortuous, we travelled from
bend {65} to bend, over the table lands on either side. In
the valley of the stream, small groves of young and thrifty
cotton-wood trees, currant bushes, and the black alder,
gave us hopes of soon seeing the grasses and flowers, and
the cool springs of the highlands, between us and the Great
Beaver [Bear] River. The day, however, was sultry;
scarcely a breath of wind moved; the dust that rose from
our track lay on the air as the smoke of a village does on
a still May morning. So that these occasional appearances
of vegetable life imparted less pleasure than they
would have done if we had been able to see them through
another medium than the dripping mud, manufactured
from dust and perspiration.</p>

<p>Near mid-day, we crossed the river from its northern
to its southern side, and were emerging from the bushes
which entangled our egress, when Jim, uttering a shrill
whoop, pointing to a solitary horseman urging his horse
up the bluff a half mile below us. Beckoning him to us,
we dismounted to allow our jaded animals to feed until
he should arrive. In the style of a true mountaineer, he
dashed up to us on a rapid gallop, greeting us with as
hearty a shake of the hand as he could have bestowed {66}
upon a brother, and asked our names and destination;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</a></span>
said his name was "Midison Gordon, an independent
trapper, that he was bound to Brown's Hole for his squaw
and 'possibles,' and was glad to see us," in less time than
is usually employed in saying half as much; and accepting
an invitation to encamp with us, he continued to express
his pleasure at seeing us, till our attention was diverted
from him by a halt for the night.</p>

<p>These remnants of the great trapping parties of the
American Fur Company,<a name="FNanchor_172" id="FNanchor_172"></a><a href="#Footnote_172" class="fnanchor">[172]</a> commonly make Brown's Hole
their winter quarters. Indeed, I believe the owners of
that post to be old trappers of the Company, who, having
lost all their relish for former habits of life, by a long residence
in the mountains, have established themselves there
in order to bring around them, not only the means of subsistence
according to their taste, but their merry old companions
with their tales, jests, and songs, and honest and
brave hearts. Gordon, like all other trappers whom I saw
in the mountains, was convinced that there were so few
beaver, so little meat, and so many dangers among them,
that "a white man had no business there." He, therefore,
was going for his {67} squaw and "possibles," preparatory
to descending the Columbia to open a farm in
the valley of the Willamette. He said that was also the
intention of nearly all his fellow-trappers. They proposed
to take with them their Indian wives and children, settle
in one neighbourhood, and cultivate the earth, or hunt,
as inclination or necessity might suggest, and thus pass
the evening of their days among the wild pleasures of that
delightful wilderness.</p>

<p>26th. Course north-west; distance twenty miles; sometimes
on the banks of the river, and again over the swells,
to avoid its windings. The country through which we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</a></span>
passed to-day, was in some respects more interesting than
any we had seen since leaving Brown's Hole. Instead
of plateaux, baked and flinty, or hills of loose unproductive
loam and sand, shorn by perpetual drought of
flower, shrub, and tree, a journey of twenty miles over
which would hardly cross grass enough to feed a dozen
horses a single day, the slopes of a thousand spherical
hills, as green as the fields of the States in May, sent forth
the sweet fragrance of teeming vegetation; little streams
ran away among the black, white, and orange pebbles;
and the dandelion, {68} anemone, and other flowers rejoiced
in the spring-day breezes which crept over them.
It was May indeed here. The snow had lately disappeared,
and the rains had still later been falling, as they
do in April in other places. The insects were piping the
note of an opening year.</p>

<p>It was the dividing ridge between the tributaries of the
Sheetskadee and Great Bear River; and yet not a ridge.<a name="FNanchor_173" id="FNanchor_173"></a><a href="#Footnote_173" class="fnanchor">[173]</a>
When viewed from its highest points, it appeared an elevated
plateau of slightly conical swells, so raised above the
vast deserts on the east of it, as to attract the moisture of
the clouds. The soil of this region is, however, poor,&mdash;not
sufficient to bear timber. The grasses grow rankly
over most of its surface; and those parts which are barren
are covered with red or white sand, that contrasts beautifully
with the matted green of other portions. In a word,
it was one of those places among the mountains where
all is pure. There the air is dense&mdash;the water cold&mdash;the
vegetation fresh; there the snow lies nine months of
the year, and when it eventually melts before the warm
suns of June and July, the earth is clothed with vegetation
almost in a day. About sunset, we descended a sharp
declivity of broken {69} rocks, and encamped on a small
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</a></span>stream running north. My indefatigable Jim Shoshonie
killed an antelope for our suppers. An unexpected favour
this; for, from the representations given me of this part of
my route, I expected to commence here a long-consuming
fast, which would not be broken till I reached Fort Hall,
or my grave.</p>

<p>27th. Our last night's encampment proved to have
been on a branch of the Great Bear River&mdash;the principal,
if not the only feeder of the Great Salt Lake.<a name="FNanchor_174" id="FNanchor_174"></a><a href="#Footnote_174" class="fnanchor">[174]</a> We
started down along its verdant little valley about seven
o'clock in the morning, and reached the main river about
twelve at noon. It was twenty yards wide&mdash;water two
feet deep, and transparent, current four miles per hour,
bottom of brown sand and gravel. After feeding our animals,
we descended the river till four o'clock, and halted
on its banks for the night. We had travelled thirty miles.
The mountains which hemmed in the valley were generally
of a conical form, primitive, and often verdant. Their
height varied from five hundred to two thousand five
hundred feet above the level of the stream. The bottom
lands were from one to three miles wide, of a {70} loose, dry,
gravelly soil, covered with withered bunch grass. By
the water side grew various kinds of trees, as quaking-asp,
black birch, and willows; also shrubs of various
kinds, as the black alder, small willow, wild wormwood,
black currant, and service berry. In the ravines of the
mountains, groves of trees sometimes appeared peering
up luxuriantly among the black projecting cliffs.</p>

<p>28th. An early rising, a hurried meal, and a rapid saddling
and packing of horses, started us from camp at six
o'clock. While girding our saddle animals, the last act
done in breaking up camp in mountain life, Jim's eagle
eye discerned in the distance down the river, "hos, hos."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</a></span></p>
<p>Indian like, for we had become such in our habits, we
put new caps on our rifles, mounted quickly, and circled
out behind a barricade of brushwood, in order to ascertain
the number, colour, and purpose of such unceremonious
intruders upon the territories of our solitude. Jim
peered through the leaves with the utmost intensity of an
Indian's vision. It was the place for war-parties of the
Crows, Sioux, and Blackfeet; and this early appearance
of individuals approaching our camp was a circumstance
that scented strongly of bows {71} and arrows. But suspense
became certainty, a pleasant certainty, as Jim reined
his horse from concealment, and galloped away to the
stranger, now within rifle-shot of us.</p>

<p>A strong and warm shake of the hand, and various contortions
of the face, and uncouth gestures of recognition
between them, completed their interview, and the swarthy
old trapper approached myself and men. He was no
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</a></span>less a personage than the bear-killer, Meek, who figures
in the St. Louis Museum, with the paws of an immense
grisly bear upon his shoulders in front, the fingers and
thumb of his left hand bitten off, while with his right hand
he holds the hunter's knife, plunged deeply in the animal's
jugular vein.<a name="FNanchor_175" id="FNanchor_175"></a><a href="#Footnote_175" class="fnanchor">[175]</a> He accosted me with, "Good morning,
how are ye?&mdash;stranger in the mountains, eh?" And
before I could make a monosyllabic reply, he continued,
"Have you any meat? Come, I've got the shoulder of
a goat, (antelope); let us go back to your camp, and cook,
and eat, and talk awhile." We were harnessed for the
day's ride, and felt unwilling to lose the cool hours of the
morning, and much more so to consume the generous
man's last pound of meat. Thanking him, {72} therefore,
for his honest kindness, we satisfied him with our
refusal, by the assurance that we had meat, and had
already breakfasted. On hearing that we were travelling
to the Columbia river, he informed us that we might
probably go down with the Nez Perc&eacute;s Indians, who, he
stated, were encamped at the time on Salmon river, one
day's journey from Fort Hall. He was on his way to
Brown's Hole for his squaw and "possibles," with the
design of joining their camp. These Indians would leave
their hunting grounds for their homes about ten days from
that date.</p>

<p>This was another remnant of the American Fur Company's
trapping parties. He came to the mountains many
years ago, and has so long associated with Indians that
his manners much resemble theirs. The same wild, unsettled,
watchful expression of the eye, the same unnatural
gesticulation in conversation, the same unwillingness
to use words when a sign, a contortion of the face or body,
or movement of the hand will manifest thought; in standing,
walking, riding, in all but complexion, he was an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</a></span>
Indian. Bidding us good morning, and wheeling away
to the day's ride, he said, "Keep your eye shining for the
Blackfeet. {73} They are about the 'Beer Springs'; and
stay, my white horse tired, one camp down the river; was
obliged to '<i>cache</i>' my pack and leave him; use him if
you can, and take him on to the Fort; and look here, I
have told you I am Meek, the bear-killer, and so I am.
But I think the boys at the museum in St. Louis might
have done me up as it really was. The beast only jumped
on my back, and stripped off my blanket; scratched some,
but didn't pull my shoulder blade off. Well, after he had
robbed me of my blanket, I shoved my rifle against him,
and blew out his heart. That's all&mdash;no fingers bitten
off, no knifing; I merely drove a little lead into his palpitator."</p>

<p>So saying, he spurred his weary animal to a trot, and
was soon hidden among the underbrush of the intervales.
Meek was evidently very poor. He had scarcely clothing
enough to cover his body; and while talking with us,
the frosty winds which sucked up the valley, made him
shiver like an aspen leaf. He reverted to his destitute
situation, and complained of the injustice of his former
employers, the little remuneration he had received for the
toils and dangers he had endured on their account, &amp;c.,
a complaint which I had {74} heard from every trapper
whom I had met on my journey. The valley opened wider
as we pursued our way along its northern side; the soil,
the water, and vegetation much the same in quantity and
quality as those which we had passed on the 27th. The
mountains on either hand spread into rocky precipitous
ridges, piled confusedly one above another in dark threatening
masses. Among them hung, in beautiful wildness
from the crevices of the cliffs, numerous shrub cedars.</p>

<p>The mountain flax was very abundant and ripe. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</a></span>
root resembled that of perennial plants, the fibres that of
the annual blue-bowl of the States, the flower the same, the
seed vessel the same; but the seeds themselves were much
smaller, and of a very dark brown colour. This valley is
the grain-field and root-garden of the Shoshonie Indians;
for there grow in it a number of kinds of edible roots, which
they dig in August, and dry for winter use. There is also
here a kind of grass, bearing a seed of half the size of the
common rye, and similar in form. This they also gather,
and parch and store away in leather sacks, for the season
of want. These Indians had been gathering in their roots,
&amp;c., a few {75} days previous to our arrival. I was
informed, however, that the crop was barely sufficient
to subsist them while harvesting it. But, in order to
prevent their enemies from finding whatever might have
escaped their own search, they had burned over large
sections of the most productive part. This day's ride
was estimated at thirty miles. Our camp at night was
in a dense copse of black alders by the water-side. Ate
our last meat for supper&mdash;no prospect of getting more
until we should arrive at Fort Hall, four days' ride.</p>

<p>29th. Up with the sun and on march. After an hour's
ride, we came upon Meek's white horse. He came to us
on as fast a gallop, and with as noisy a neighing as if Zimmerman
had never dipt his quill in solitude, and wrote
the laws for destroying nature, for nature's good. Jim
now put spur to his noble animal, with the regularity of
the march of the tread-mill. And, by way of apology for
his haste, pointed to the ground, and laying his head on
one shoulder, and snoring, said, "u&mdash;gh, ugh," which
being interpreted, meant that our next snoring place was
a very, very long day's journey away. And one acquainted
with Indian firmness, would have read in {76} his countenance,
while making this communication, a determination<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</a></span>
to reach it before nightfall, whatever might be the consequences.
And so we did. At sunset our camp kettle
was bubbling over the bones of a pelican at the "Steamboat
spring." The part of the valley seen to-day was generally
covered with a stout coat of bunch grass. This,
and other indications, led me to suppose it fertile. Yet
it appeared questionable if it would yield the ordinary
fruits of agriculture without being irrigated.<a name="FNanchor_176" id="FNanchor_176"></a><a href="#Footnote_176" class="fnanchor">[176]</a></p>

<p>I noticed, however, during the day's ride, a number of
points at which the waters of the river might be conducted
over very large tracts of excellent soil. The scarcity of
fencing timber appeared an obstacle, certainly; but other
than this, there seemed to me no considerable cause of
doubt that the valley of the Great Bear River will, in the
course of time, become one of the most prosperous abodes
of cultivated life. Its situation, so remote from either
ocean, only increases our expectation of such an event,
when it is recollected that the most practicable waggon
route between the States and Oregon Territory and the
Californias, runs through it.</p>

<p>The north end of the Great Salt Lake is {77} thirty miles
from our present encampment, and the mountains on the
borders of the valley are more abrupt and craggy, the
water of the stream more abundant, and the soil more
productive, than in the part already described. A number
of creeks also entering the main stream from the East,
open up among the black heights a number of lesser and
charming vales; and around the union of the river with
the Lake are excellent water, soil and timber, under skies
of perpetual spring. Of the Lake itself I heard much from
different individuals who had visited different portions
of its coast.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</a></span></p>
<p>The substance of their statements, in which they all
agree, is that it is about two hundred miles long, eighty
or one hundred wide; the water exceedingly heavy; and
so salt, say they in their simple way, that pieces of wood
dipped in it and dried in the sun are thickly frosted with
pure white salt; that its coasts are generally composed
of swells of sand and barren brown loam, on which sufficient
moisture does not fall to sustain any other vegetation
than the wild wormwood and prickly pear; that all
attempts to go round it in canoes have, after a day or two
of trial, been abandoned {78} for want of fresh water; that
the Great Bear River is the only considerable stream putting
into it; that high land is seen near the centre of it;&mdash;but
whether this be an island or a long peninsula there
was a difference of opinion among my informants. The
valleys of the Great Bear River and its tributaries, as well
as the northern portion of the Lake, are supposed to be
within the territory of the States.<a name="FNanchor_177" id="FNanchor_177"></a><a href="#Footnote_177" class="fnanchor">[177]</a></p>

<p>The immediate neighbourhood of our encampment is
one of the most remarkable in the Rocky Mountains. The
facts that the trail to Oregon and California will for ever
of necessity, pass within three hundred yards of the place
where our camp fire is burning; that near this spot must
be erected a resting-place for the long lines of caravans
between the harbours of the Pacific and the waters of the
Missouri, would of themselves interest all who are witnessing
the irresistible movements of civilization upon
the American continent. But this spot has other objects
of interest: its Geology and its Mineralogy, and I might
well say the Chemistry of it, (for there are laboratories<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</a></span>
and gases here in the greatest profusion), will hereafter
occupy the attention of the lovers of these sciences. The
Soda Springs, called {79} by the fur traders Beer Springs,
are the most remarkable objects of the kind within my
knowledge. They are situated on the north-west side of
the river, a few rods below a grove of shrub cedars, and
about two hundred yards from the shore. There are six
groups of them; or in other words, there are six small
hollows sunken about two feet below the ground around,
of circular form, seven or eight feet in diameter, in which
are a number of fountains sending up large quantities
of gas and water, and emitting a noise resembling the boiling
of immense cauldrons. These pools are usually clear,
with a gravelly bottom. In some of them, however, grow
bogs or hassocks of coarse grass, among which are many
little wells, where the water bubbled so merrily that I was
tempted to drink at one of them. But as I proceeded to
do so, the suffocating properties of the gas instantly drove
me from my purpose. After this rebuff, however, I made
another attempt at a more open fountain, and drank with
little difficulty.</p>

<p>The waters appeared to be more highly impregnated
with soda and acid than those of Saratoga; were extremely
pleasant to the taste, and fumed from the {80} stomach
like the soda water of the shops. Some of them threw
off at least four gallons of gas a second. And although
they cast up large masses of water continually, for which
there appeared no outlet, yet at different times of observation
I could perceive no increase or diminution of the
quantity visible. There are five or six other springs in
the bank of the river just below, the waters of which resemble
those I have described. One of them discharges
about forty gallons a minute.</p>

<p>One fourth of a mile down stream from the Soda<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</a></span>
Spring, is what is called "The Steamboat Spring." The
orifice from which it casts its water is in the face of a perpendicular
rock on the brink of the stream, which seems
to have been formed by the depositions of the fountain.
It is eight inches in diameter. Six feet from this, and
on the horizontal plane of the rock, is another orifice in
the cavern below. On approaching the spring, a deep
gurgling, hissing sound is heard underground. It appears
to be produced by the generating of gas in a cavernous
receiver. This, when the chamber is filled, bursts through
another cavern filled with water, which it thrusts frothing
and foaming into the stream. In {81} passing the
smaller orifice, the pent gas escapes with very much the
same sound as steam makes in the escape-pipe of a steamboat.
Hence the name. The periods of discharge are
very irregular. At times, they occur once in two, at
others, once in three, four or five minutes. The force of
its action also is subject to great variation. Those who
have been there, often say that its noise has been heard
to echo far among the hills. When I visited it I could not
hear it at the distance of two hundred yards. There is
also said to be a difference at different times in the temperature
of the water. When I examined it, it was a little
above blood heat. Others have seen it much higher.</p>

<p>The most remarkable phenomenon connected with these
springs, remains yet to be noticed. The whole river,
from the Steamboat spring to the Soda Springs, (a distance
of more than a fourth of a mile), is a sheet of springs,
thousands in number, which bursting through two feet
of superincumbent running water, throw their foaming
jets, some six inches, and some less, above the surface.
The water is much the same in its constituent qualities,
as that of the Soda springs.<a name="FNanchor_178" id="FNanchor_178"></a><a href="#Footnote_178" class="fnanchor">[178]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</a></span></p>

<p>{82} There are in the immediate vicinity of the Steamboat
Spring, and on the opposite side of the river numerous
rocks with orifices in their centres, and other evidences
of having been formed by intermittent springs that have
long ago ceased to act.</p>

<p>The scenery around these wonderful fountains, is very
wild. To the east north-east, opens up the upper valley of
Great Bear River, walled in on either side by dark primitive
mountains, beetling over the vale, and towering on
the sky. To the south south-west sweeps away the
lower valley.&mdash;On either side of it rise lofty mountains
of naked rocks, the wild sublimity of which contrasts
strikingly with the sweet beauty of the stream and vale
below.</p>

<p>Although statements in regard to what shall transpire
in the future, are always a work more befitting a seer than
a journalist, yet I cannot forbear expressing the belief that
the healthiness and beauty of their locality&mdash;the magnificence
of the scenery on the best routes to them from
the States and from the Pacific, the manifest superiority
of these waters over any others, will cause "The Soda
Springs" to be thronged with the gay and fashionable of
both sides of the continent.</p>

<p>{83} 30th. Our sleep had been interrupted at midnight
by the blazing fires of an Indian encampment on a
neighbouring hill. And once awakened by such a cause,
the tracks of a war party, probably of Blackfeet, which
we had crossed during the day, were sufficient to put us
on duty the remainder of the night. At early dawn, we
saddled and moved in silence a few hundred yards down
the river, turned to the right around the Bute in the rear
of the Steamboat spring, entered the "Valley of chasms,"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[Pg 299]</a></span>and soon brought the mountains on its northern border,
between us and our suspicious neighbours.</p>

<p>This valley derives its name from the numerous cracks
or chasms in the volcanic rocks on which it rests. They
are so wide and deep that the natives, for many miles at
the lower part of it, have been obliged to run their trail
over the lower swells of the hills on its north-western side.
Up this trail Jim rode on a brisk trot, beckoning us, in an
ominous manner to follow, and keep in a body near him.
The "cut rock" and scori&aelig; lay every where, and crippled
the poor animals at almost every step. Onward he led
us, with all the speed which the severest inflictions of spur
and whip could {84} produce, till the shutting in of night
deposited us among the willows on the stream of the valley,
forty miles from our last night's encampment. The
rapidity of our travelling to-day, allowed me little time
to examine this singular valley. I noticed merely that
it was, like the intervales of Bear River, covered with
bunch-grass, which the thirsty suns of summer had dried
to hay. A curious gas spring also attracted my attention
about nine o'clock in the morning. Its bubbling and its
beautiful reservoir appeared to arouse the admiration even
of my dogged guide Jim: he halted to look at it. Jim,
for the first time since I had had the honour of his acquaintance,
absolutely stopped to look at, and admire a portion
of the earth. It was a fine specimen of Nature's masonry.
The basin was about six feet in diameter; the bottom a
circular horizontal plane; around the edge rose a rim or
flanche, eight inches in height; all one solid rock. In
the centre of the bottom arose the gas and water: the latter
was six inches deep, limpid, and slightly acid. This fountain
was situated a few rods to the right of the trail.</p>

<p>31st. We took to our saddles, and in three hours
reached the foot of the mountains {85} which divide the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[Pg 300]</a></span>
"Valley of chasms" from Snake River. There is a wide
depression through the heights here of so gentle a declination,
that loaded waggons can pass from one valley to the
other without difficulty. Up this we turned. It was covered
with green grass and shrubs and trees, among which
a little brook was whispering to the solitude.<a name="FNanchor_179" id="FNanchor_179"></a><a href="#Footnote_179" class="fnanchor">[179]</a></p>

<p>The small birds, too, were chirping among the bright
flowers and bending boughs; and on either hand, as if
to guard so much loveliness from the winds of surrounding
desolation, the black crags rose and frowned one thousand
five hundred feet in air. But hunger!! Every
bud was fed; every bird had its nourishment; the lizards
even were not starving. We were. When about half
way up the gorge, one of Smith's horses tired and refused
to go farther. The fellow's wound, received in the plains,
had healed; and with strength from time to time, his petty
tyranny towards his animals increased till being entirely
recovered, he seemed to have resumed a degree of malignity
towards them whenever they did not chance to comprehend
his wishes, or were unable to comply with them,
that would be incredible if described. In this case, he {86}
cut a strong goad; and following the slow steps of the
worn-out animal, struck her lengthwise over the almost
denuded ribs as frequently and as long as he had strength
to do it; and then would rest and strike again with renewed
vengeance, until his beast dropped her head and received
his blows without a movement. Remonstrance, and the
astonished gazing of my savage guide, only increased his
severity. And thus he continued to beat the poor animal,
till, being convinced against his will, that he even could
not make a dying horse heed his command, he bestowed
upon her a farewell kick and curse and left her.</p>

<p>About four o'clock we stood on the high ground which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[Pg 301]</a></span>
divides the waters of the little brook which we had followed
up, from a small head stream of Portneuf. The
valley of the great southern branch of the Columbia, was
spread out before us. Slaking our thirst at a cool spring,
we travelled five miles down the mountain, and encamped
in sight of the Trois Butes.<a name="FNanchor_180" id="FNanchor_180"></a><a href="#Footnote_180" class="fnanchor">[180]</a> When we halted, I was
too much exhausted with hunger and fatigue to unsaddle
my horse. We had been on short allowance most of the
time since leaving Fort David Crockett. The day on
which we arrived at the Soda Springs, I ate {87} the
eighth part of a pelican; the two last past days, nothing.
But I suffered less from the gnawings of hunger than I
had on the previous night. A deadly stupor pervaded
the gastric and nervous systems; a sluggish action of the
heart, a dimness of vision and painful prostration of every
energy of life were creeping upon me. After a little rest,
however, I crept to the bushes, and after a long search,
found two red rosebuds! These I gladly ate, and went
to my couch to dream of feasts.</p>

<p>The 1st of September was a fine day. The sun was
bright and unclouded, as he came in his strength over the
eastern mountains, and awakened us from our slumbers
among the alders on the bank of Portneuf. Hunger,
indeed, was still gnawing at our vitals. But sleep had
banished weariness, and added something to the small
stock of our remaining strength; and the recollection of
past perils&mdash;perils of floods, of tempests, of Indian foes&mdash;death
threatened at every step during a journey of three
months in the plains and mountains&mdash;the inspiring view
of the vale of the great southern branch of the Columbia,
so long promised us in hope along our weary way&mdash;the
fact that we were in Oregon, unmoored the mind from {88}<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[Pg 302]</a></span>
its anxieties, and shed over us a gladness which can only
be comprehended by those who, having suffered as we
had, have viewed as we did, from some bright height, their
sufferings ended, in the rich, ripe possession of the objects
so ardently sought. We were in Oregon. Fort Hall lay
in the plain before us. Its hospitalities would be enjoyed
ere sunset. Our wardrobes were overhauled, our razors
put on duty, our sunburnt frames bathed in the Portneuf;
and equipped in our best, our hearts beat joyfully back
the rapid clattering of our horses' hoofs on the pavements
of the mountains, as we rushed to the plains. An hour
among the sands and wild wormwood, an hour among the
oozing springs, and green grass around them, an hour along
the banks of Saptin River, and we passed a line of timber
springing at right angles into the plain; and before us
rose the white battlements of Fort Hall!<a name="FNanchor_181" id="FNanchor_181"></a><a href="#Footnote_181" class="fnanchor">[181]</a></p>

<p>As we emerged from this wood, Jim intimated that
we should discharge our rifles; and as we did so, a
single armed horseman issued from the gate of the Fort
approached us warily, and skulking among the copses,
scanned us in the most inquisitive manner. Having satisfied
himself at {89} last that our skins were originally
intended to be white, he came alongside; and learning
that we were from the States; that we had no hostile
intentions; that we knew Mr. Walker to be in the Fort,
and would be glad to have our compliments conveyed
to him, he returned; and Mr. Walker immediately appeared.<a name="FNanchor_182" id="FNanchor_182"></a><a href="#Footnote_182" class="fnanchor">[182]</a>
A friendly salutation was followed by an
invitation to enter the Fort; and a "welcome to Fort Hall,"
was given in a manner so kind and obliging, that nothing
seemed wanting to make us feel that we were at home.
A generous flagon of Old Jamaica, wheaten bread, and
butter newly churned, and buffalo tongues fresh from the
neighbouring mountains, made their appearance as soon
as we had rid ourselves of the equipage and dust of journeying,
and allayed the dreadful sense of starvation.</p>

<i>ante</i>, p. <a href="#Page_173">173</a>, note 108). They left the frontier in a caravan of twenty-seven persons,
of whom nine were employ&eacute;s of Chouteau's fur company, and the others
heterogeneous travellers and immigrants. Wislizenus had intended to go on to
Oregon and then to California; but the divisions in the party, and the lateness
of the season, determined him to return from Fort Hall. Two of his companions
joined him, and they engaged Richardson, who had taken the outward journey
in the capacity of hunter, to guide them back, purposing to take the southerly
route on the return. Dr. Wislizenus had undertaken this journey for the sake of
his health, as well as in order to see the marvels of the Western mountains. Richardson
was chief hunter for Wyeth's party in 1833. Townsend well describes

educated in New England, but taking a theological course at Oberlin, where he
was graduated in 1838. He prepared to go out to the Indians as an independent
missionary, and was dispatched by the Congregational church in Litchfield, Connecticut.
Having engaged Asahel Munger, a skilled mechanic, to accompany
him, he stopped in St. Louis long enough to marry, and left the frontier the last
of April, 1839. At Fort Hall, Griffin, because of some differences, left Munger and
pushed on to Lapwai, where he spent the winter, Munger having meanwhile
joined Dr. Whitman who gladly employed him at his mission for a year and a
half. In the spring of 1840 Griffin attempted a mission to the Shoshoni; but
becoming discouraged, pressed on to Fort Vancouver, where he spent the second
winter, establishing in 1841 a settlement at Tualatin Plains, near the present
Hillsboro. He was active in establishing the provisional government, being suggested
as candidate for governor, but opposed on account of his profession. Griffin
was the editor of the first Oregon magazine, <i>Oregon American and Evangelical
Unionist</i>, eight numbers of which were published (1848-49). He established a
Congregational church, the first in Washington County, and lived in Oregon
until his death in February, 1899. Munger became deranged, and as a religious
test cast himself into fire, dying from his injuries, near Salem, Oregon.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_175" id="Footnote_175"></a><a href="#FNanchor_175"><span class="label">[175]</span></a> Col. Joseph L. Meek (1810-75) was one of the most picturesque of the "mountain
men" who settled in Oregon. An extended account of his adventures was
published by Frances Fuller Victor, under the title <i>River of the West</i> (Hartford,
1870). Born in Washington County, Virginia, he left home while still a boy, and
in 1829 joined Sublette's caravan for the mountain trade. During eleven years
he experienced adventures similar to those of other hunters and trappers, in one
of which he killed a grizzly bear. The Englishman Stuart (see our volume xxi,
p. 197, note 42), coming up with his artist Miller, had a sketch made of the beast
which was afterwards elaborated into a picture, and later a wax model for the St.
Louis Museum (<i>River of the West</i>, pp. 220-223). Meek went out to Oregon in
1840, settling on Tualatin Plains, where he was active in establishing the provisional
government, of which he was first sheriff. After the Whitman massacre of
1847 he was the accredited messenger to Washington, D. C., to obtain consideration
for the condition of Oregon. His visit to the East was replete with amusing
adventures. Returning as United States marshal, he acted as guide to the party
sent to escort to his post the first American governor of Oregon, General Joseph
Lane. Meek was prominent in Oregon throughout his later life, being generally
known as "Uncle Joe," and he aided in founding the Pioneer Association. See
Oregon Pioneer Association <i>Transactions</i>, 1875. His meeting with Farnham is
mentioned by Frances Fuller Victor in <i>River of the West</i>, p. 256. For a portrait
of Meek, see the frontispiece to that volume, also Lyman, <i>History of Oregon</i>, iii,

<p>It will not be uninteresting while pausing here, and
making preparations to descend Snake, Lewis, or Saptin
river,<a name="FNanchor_183" id="FNanchor_183"></a><a href="#Footnote_183" class="fnanchor">[183]</a> to lead my readers back over that portion of my
journey which lay among the mountains. I do not design
to retrace my steps here, however, in order again to attempt
a description of sufferings which can never be described.
They are past; and let their remembrance {91} die. But
a succinct account of the region lying west of the Anahuac
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[Pg 304]</a></span>ridge, and between latitudes 39&deg; and 42&deg; north&mdash;its mountains,
its plains, its rivers, &amp;c., will, I persuade myself, be
new, and not without interest to the reader.</p>

<p>James' Peak, Pike's Peak, and Long's Peak, may be
called the outposts of a lofty range of rocky mountains,
which, for convenience in description, I have called Long's
Range, extending nearly due north from the Arkansas,
in latitude 39&deg;, to the Great Gap in latitude 42&deg; north.<a name="FNanchor_184" id="FNanchor_184"></a><a href="#Footnote_184" class="fnanchor">[184]</a></p>

<p>The range is unconnected with any other. It is separated
from the Wind River Mountains by the Great Gap
or Great Southern Pass, and from the Great Anahuac
Range by the upper valleys of the Arkansas, those of the
South Fork of the Platte, and those of the Green and
Grand rivers. Two spurs spring off from it to the west:
the one from James' Peak, the other from Long's Peak.
These spurs, as they proceed westward, dip lower and
lower till they terminate&mdash;the first in the rough cliffs
around the upper waters of the Arkansas, and the latter
in spherical sand-hills around the lower waters of Grand
river.<a name="FNanchor_185" id="FNanchor_185"></a><a href="#Footnote_185" class="fnanchor">[185]</a> The Anahuac Mountains were seen from about
latitude 39&deg; to {92} 42&deg; north. This range lies about two
hundred miles west of Long's Range, and between latitude
39 and 40&deg;, has a general course of north north-west.
It appeared an unbroken ridge of ice and snow, rising in
some points, I think, more than fifteen thousand feet
above the level of the sea. From latitude 41&deg; it tends to
the north-west by west, past the north-eastern shore of
the Great Salt Lake to the northern end of it; and thence
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[Pg 305]</a></span>westwardly to a point south of Portneuf, where it unites
with the range of the Snowy Mountains.</p>

<p>The Snowy Mountains are a transverse range or spur
of the Rocky Mountains, which run from the Wind River
Mountains, latitude 42&deg; north, in nearly a right line to
Cape Mendocino, latitude 40&deg;, in Upper California.
Many portions of this range, east as well as west of Fort
Hall, are very lofty, and covered with perpetual snow.
About one hundred miles from the coast of the Pacific it
intersects that range of snowy peaks called the President's
Range, which comes down from Puget's sound, and terminates
in the arid plains about the mouth of the Colorado
of the West.<a name="FNanchor_186" id="FNanchor_186"></a><a href="#Footnote_186" class="fnanchor">[186]</a></p>

<p>{93} The Wind River Mountains are a spur which shoots
from the great northern chain, commonly called the Rocky
Mountains, in latitude 42&deg; and odd minutes north; and
running in a south-easterly direction into the Great Prairie
Wilderness, forms the northern wall of the Great Gap or
Great Southern Pass.<a name="FNanchor_187" id="FNanchor_187"></a><a href="#Footnote_187" class="fnanchor">[187]</a></p>

<p>On the northern side of the Wind River Peaks, are the
sources of Jefferson, Madison, and Gallatin rivers;<a name="FNanchor_188" id="FNanchor_188"></a><a href="#Footnote_188" class="fnanchor">[188]</a> on
the south-eastern side rises the Sweetwater, the north-western-most
branch of the North Fork of the Great
Platte; on the southern side the Sheetskadee or Green
river, the northern branch of the Colorado of the West;
on the north-western side and north of the Snowy Mountains,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[Pg 306]</a></span>spring down the Saptin, Snake, or Lewis river, the
great southern branch of the Columbia.</p>

<p>On the western side of Long's Range, rises the Grand
river, the principal branch of the Colorado of the West.<a name="FNanchor_189" id="FNanchor_189"></a><a href="#Footnote_189" class="fnanchor">[189]</a>
It furnishes four times the quantity of water that Green
river does. Further south, in the vicinity of James' Peak,
and on the west side of this range, rises the South Fork
of the Great Platte.<a name="FNanchor_190" id="FNanchor_190"></a><a href="#Footnote_190" class="fnanchor">[190]</a></p>

<p>Close under the eastern base of the Anahuac {94} or
Great Main Ridge, and nearly in latitude 39&frac12;&deg; north, are
the sources of the Arkansas.</p>

<p>The immense parallelogram lying within these ranges
of mountains, may be described by saying that it is a desert
of arid plains and minor mountains. And if this
general appellation be qualified by the accounts given
on previous pages of Boyou Salade, Old Park, &amp;c. very
small portions of the whole area, the description will be
complete.</p>

<p>Fort Hall was built by Captain Wyeth, of Boston in 1832,
for the purposes of trade with the Indians in its vicinity.
He had taken goods into the lower part of the Territory,
to exchange for salmon. But competition soon drove
him from his fisheries to this remote spot, where he hoped
to be permitted to purchase furs of the Indians without
being molested by the Hudson's Bay Company, whose
nearest post was seven hundred miles away.<a name="FNanchor_191" id="FNanchor_191"></a><a href="#Footnote_191" class="fnanchor">[191]</a></p>

<p>In this he was disappointed. In pursuance of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[Pg 307]</a></span>avowed doctrine of that company, that no others have a
right to trade in furs west of the Rocky Mountains, whilst
the use of capital and their incomparable skill and perseverance
can prevent it, they established a fort near him,
preceded him, {95} followed him, surrounded him every
where, and cut the throat of his prosperity with such
kindness, and politeness, that Wyeth was induced to sell
his whole interest, existent and prospective, in Oregon, to
his generous but too indefatigable, skilful, and powerful
antagonists.</p>

<p>From what I saw and heard of Wyeth's management
in Oregon, I was impressed with the belief that he was,
beyond comparison, the most talented business-man from
the States that ever established himself in the Territory.</p>

<p>The business of this post consists in exchanging blankets,
ammunition, guns, tobacco, &amp;c., with the neighbouring
Indians, for the skins of the beaver and land otter; and
in furnishing white men with traps, horses, saddles, bridles,
provisions, &amp;c., to enable them to hunt these animals for
the benefit and sole use of the owners, the Hudson's Bay
Company. In such cases the horses are borrowed without
price; the other articles of the "outfit" sold on credit till
the termination of the hunt; and the only security which
the Company requires for the return of their animals, is
the pledge of honour to that effect, and that the furs taken
shall be appropriated at a stipulated price to the payment
of arrears.</p>

<p>{96} Goods are sold at this establishment fifty per cent
lower than at the American posts. White trappers are
paid a higher price for their furs than is paid the Indians;
are charged less for the goods which they receive in
exchange; and are treated in every respect by this shrewd
Company with such uniform justice, that the American
trappers even are fast leaving the service of their country<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[Pg 308]</a></span>men,
for the larger profits and better treatment of British
employment. There is also a company of men connected
with this Fort, under the command of an American mountaineer,
who, following various tribes in their migratory
expeditions in the adjacent American and Mexican domain,
collect whatever furs may chance to be among them.</p>

<p>By these means, and various others subsidiary to them,
the gentlemen in charge of this trading establishment,
collected, in the summer of 1839, more than thirty packs
of the best beaver of the mountains.</p>

<p>We spent the 2nd and 3rd most agreeably with Mr. Walker,
in his hospitable adobie castle; exchanged with him our
wearied horses for fresh ones; and obtained dried buffalo
meat, sugar, cocoa, tea, and corn meal, a guide, and
every other necessary within that gentleman's {97} power
to furnish for our journey to Wallawalla. And at ten
o'clock, <span class="smcap">A. M.</span>, of the 4th of September, we bade adieu to
our very obliging countryman, and took to our saddles
on the trail down the desert banks of the Saptin. As we
left the Fort, we passed over the ground of an affray, which
originated in love and terminated in death. Yes, love
on the western declivity of the Rocky Mountains! and
love of a white man for an Indian dame!</p>

<p>It appeared that a certain white trapper had taken to
himself a certain bronze damsel of the wilderness to be
his slave-wife, with all the solemn ceremonies of purchase
and payment for the same in sundry horses, dogs, and
loads of ammunition, as required by the custom in such
affairs governing; and that by his business of trapping
for beaver, &amp;c., he was, soon after the banns were proclaimed,
separated from his beloved one, for the term of
three months and upwards, much against his tender
inclination and interest, as the following showeth: for
during the terms of his said absence, another white man,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[Pg 309]</a></span>
with intent to injure, &amp;c., spoke certain tender words
unto the said trapper's slave-wife, which had the {98} effect
to alienate from him the purchased and rightfully possessed
affections of his slave-spouse, in favour of her
seducer. In this said condition did the beaver-catcher
find his bride when he came in from the hunt. He loaded
his rifle, and killed the robber of his heart. The grave
of the victim is there&mdash;a warning to all who would trifle
with the vested rights of an American trapper in the love
of an Indian beauty.</p>

<p>We made about ten miles, and halted for the night.
Our guide displayed himself a five feet nine inch stout
Wallawalla.<a name="FNanchor_192" id="FNanchor_192"></a><a href="#Footnote_192" class="fnanchor">[192]</a> He had been in the service of the Hudson
Bay Company many years, and was consequently
assiduous and dutiful. Yes, consequently so; for neither
Indian nor white man is long in their service without learning
his place, and becoming active and faithful in doing
his duty. As soon as we entered camp, our pack-horses
were stripped of their burdens, and turned loose to feed;
wood was gathered, and a fire blazing under the kettles,
and "all out door" immediately rendered as comfortable
to us, as skies spangled with stars, and earth strewn with
snowy sand could be made. Wallawalla was a jolly oddity
of a mortal. The frontal region of his head had been
pressed in infancy {99} most aristocratically into the form
of the German idiots; his eyes were forced out upon the
corners of the head; his nose hugged the face closely like
a bunch of affectionate leeches; hair black as a raven,
and flowing over a pair of herculean shoulders; and feet&mdash;&mdash;but
who can describe that which has not its like under
the skies. Such was Carbo, our Palinurus over the burnt
plains of Snake River.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[Pg 310]</a></span></p>

<p>The short ride of the day had shown us the western limit
of the partial fertility about Fort Hall. The earth had
begun to be red, burnt, and barren; grass, sparse and
dry; the shrubs and cotton-woods stinted and shrivelled.</p>

<p>The plain of the Trois Butes is situated between the
Snowy mountain range on the south, and another ridge
which, diverging from it above the sources of the Saptin
River, follows that stream down to the Blue Mountains
near Wallawalla. This plain by experiment is found to
be eight thousand feet above the level of the sea. In the
vicinity of the post, there is an abundance of grass for the
subsistence of many thousands of animals. The soil, in
various parts of it, also appears well adapted to the cultivation
of the small grains and esculent roots. But {100} the
fact that frosts occur almost every month of the year, shows
the extent to which the arable sections can be rendered
available for such purposes.</p>

<p>The Trois Butes rise on the plain fifteen or twenty
miles east of the Fort.<a name="FNanchor_193" id="FNanchor_193"></a><a href="#Footnote_193" class="fnanchor">[193]</a> They are pyramidal peaks,
probably of volcanic origin, of two thousand feet in height
above the plain, and twelve thousand feet above the level
of the sea. Around their dark bases grow evergreen trees;
from their sides burst small brooks, rendering verdant strips
of the plain which radiate beautifully in all directions from
them; and over all, during most of the year, hang their
crests of glittering snows! East of the Butes, vegetation
continually decreases till it ceases in the black crags which
embosom the head streams of the river.</p>

<p>On the 5th, travelled thirty miles down the western
bank of the river;<a name="FNanchor_194" id="FNanchor_194"></a><a href="#Footnote_194" class="fnanchor">[194]</a> soil sandy and volcanic, bearing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[Pg 311]</a></span>wild wormwood&mdash;in fact a desert; crossed a number
of small streams putting into the Saptin; on these a little
bunch of grass, and a few alders and willows, tried to grow.
Whilst baiting at noon, we were agreeably surprised with
an addition to our company, of a young Swiss trapper,
eight years in the mountains; he {101} learned the silversmith
business when in youth; afterwards entered a monastery
and studied Latin, &amp;c., for the order of Priests;
ran away from the monastery, entered the French army,
deserted, and came to America; sickened, was visited by
a Roman priest who had been a classmate with him at
the monastery; and having had a more numerous family
than was required by the canons of his order, had fled to
America, where his orisons would not be disturbed by
the cries of infants. On entering our trapper's chamber
they mutually recognized each other; and horror immediately
seized the pious priest at the recollection of the trapper's
sinfulness; and particularly the sin of forsaking the
holy places of the mother church; of taking carnal
weapons in hands that had been employed in making
crosses in the sacred precincts of the cloister. The trapper
had contracted the dangerous habit of thinking for
himself, and replied to the godly man in a sharp and
retaliatory manner; and among other things drew a very
ungracious comparison between escaping from prayers
and chants, and flying from an unlawful family.</p>

<p>This reference to former delinquencies in {102} a country
to which he had fled to escape the remembrance of
them, aroused the holy indignation of the priest to such
an extent, that he immediately consigned the witness of
his fault to worms, and his soul to an apprenticeship at
fire eating in purgatory. Our trapper had become a
heretic. In the blindness of his heart he had forgotten
that the power to save and destroy the soul of man, had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[Pg 312]</a></span>
been committed to an order of men chosen, and set apart
as the repositories of that portion of Omnipotence; and
that whatever errors of conduct may occur in the life of
these men, the efficiency of the anathematizing and saving
commission is not thereby annulled; and he rose from
his bed and hurled at the priest sundry counter anathemas
in the form of chairs, and shovel and tongs. I could
perceive in him no returning belief in the Omnipotent key
of the "Roman Catholic apostolical mother Church."
Instead of saying his prayers, and counting the beads of
his rosary, he talked of the stirring scenes of a trapper's
life, and recounted the wild adventures of the mountains;
instead of the sublime Te Deum, he sang the thrilling
martial airs of his native land; instead of {103} the crosier,
he bore the faithful rifle; instead of the robes of sacred
office, he wore the fringed deer skin frock of the children
of the wilderness. He was a trapper&mdash;a merry mountain
trapper.</p>

<p>6th. Twenty-five miles to-day; face of the country,
black, hard and barren swells; encamped on a small tributary
of the Saptin; very little grass for the animals;
found here a family of the Root Digger Indians; the man
half clad, children naked, all filthy. She was clad in a
wrapper of mountain sheep skin.<a name="FNanchor_195" id="FNanchor_195"></a><a href="#Footnote_195" class="fnanchor">[195]</a></p>

<p>7th. Twenty miles. About mid-day heard a loud
roaring of waters; descended the chasm of the river and
discovered two enormous springs bursting from the basaltic
cliffs of the opposite shore. Their roaring was heard<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[Pg 313]</a></span>
three miles. The lower one discharged water enough to
turn the machinery of twenty ordinary manufactories. The
water foamed and rushed down inclined planes of rocks
the distance of two hundred feet.<a name="FNanchor_196" id="FNanchor_196"></a><a href="#Footnote_196" class="fnanchor">[196]</a> The country, an
undulating, barren, volcanic plain; near the river cut
into bluffs; lava every where; wild wormwood and
another shrub two feet in height, bearing a yellow blossom,
the only wood seen; encamped on a small stream about
three miles {104} from the river. Found here the only
grass which I had observed during the day.</p>

<p>8th. Still on the western bank of the Saptin; river
one-fourth of a mile wide; water extremely clear; current
five miles the hour; depth of water about four feet.
On the eastern side, the soil appeared a dark mass of
imbedded fused rock, stretching in broken undulations
to the distant highlands. In that direction twenty miles
lay a range of mountains like an irregular line of darkness
on the horizon. Every thing touched by our horses'
feet claimed a volcano for its birth-place. Thirty miles
to-day.</p>

<p>9th. Face of the country the same as that passed over
on the 8th&mdash;scarcely grass enough to feed our animals,
and that dried to hay. The mountains on the west side
of the river gradually nearing it. No timber since we left
the immediate vicinity of Fort Hall. We cooked our food
with the willow bushes which the Indians had killed and
rendered dry for such purposes. All the rocks more or
less fused; many large tracts of lava; a number of clear
little brooks bubbling over the cinders of this great hearth
of Nature's fire. Made forty miles.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[Pg 314]</a></span></p>
<p>10th. Fifteen miles over "cut rock" and wormwood
deserts; and at mid-day descended {105} about six hundred
feet in the chasm of the Saptin, and travelled along
the brink of the river a short distance; crossed at a place
called "The Islands," to the eastern shore.<a name="FNanchor_197" id="FNanchor_197"></a><a href="#Footnote_197" class="fnanchor">[197]</a></p>

<p>The river has been dipping deeper in the plain the last
three days. A bird's eye view of it for sixty miles above
the Islands would present a tortuous chasm, walled by
basalt, trap, &amp;c., and sunk along the centre of the valley,
from one hundred to eight hundred feet deep, a black
chasm, destitute of timber and other evidences of fertility,
from a quarter to half a mile in width. In the centre of
the bottom rushes the Saptin; over rocks and gravel a
clear, pure, strong stream, with a current of five miles to
the hour; water three and four feet in depth. Travelled
seven or eight miles from the ford and fell in with eight
or ten springs of limpid water, bubbling through the flinty
crust of the plain. The sun was pouring upon us his
fiercest rays, and our thirst was excessive. A halting,
dismounting and rushing to the water, the application of
our giant's lips to the liquid&mdash;a paralysis of his thirst
produced by the boiling hot sensation which it imparted
to his swearing apparatus, prepared us to resume our ride.
Hot springs, {106} boiling hot&mdash;no apparent mineral
properties.<a name="FNanchor_198" id="FNanchor_198"></a><a href="#Footnote_198" class="fnanchor">[198]</a></p>

<p>11th. Travelled to-day thirty-five miles over an irregular,
rough, unseemly desert; volcanic stones strewn every
where on a black, impenetrable, baked surface; soil too
poor to bear the wormwood&mdash;trail too far east to see
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[Pg 315]</a></span>the river. At ten o'clock, met a petty chief of the Snake
Root Diggers and his son on horseback, from Boisais river.
He was dressed in a blanket coat, deer skin pants, and
moccasins garnished with cut glass beads and strips of
red flannel; the boy entirely naked. Carbo learned from
him the situation of his tribe, and a few bits of Indian
scandal, ascertained that we could reach Boisais river the
next day, and that we could probably obtain fresh horses
there. His copper-coloured highness than left us to pursue
his way to Fort Hall, to get his guns repaired, and we
continued ours to the lower Columbia, to get out of this
grave of desolation. I had not seen an acre of land since
leaving Fort Hall, capable of producing the grains or
vegetables. Encamped on a small brook running westwardly
towards the Saptin.</p>

<p>12th. On route at six o'clock in the morning; horses
weary, and getting crippled {107} pitifully on the "cut
rock;" face of the country absolute sterility; our trail
near the mountains, about two hundred miles east of the
Saptin.<a name="FNanchor_199" id="FNanchor_199"></a><a href="#Footnote_199" class="fnanchor">[199]</a> At nine o'clock, came to the bluff overlooking
Boisais river. Here the valley is sunken six or seven hundred
feet; the whole of it below, to the limit of sight,
appears to have subsided nearly to a level with the waters
of the Saptin. Lines of timber ran along the Boisais,
and plats of green grass and shrubs dotted its banks. The
mountains, whence the river came, rose in dark stratified
ridges. Where the stream escaped from them, there was
an immense chasm, with perpendicular sides, which seemed
to open into their most distant bases. Horrid crags
beetled over its dismal depths. Lofty, rocky ridges
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[Pg 316]</a></span>extended far into the north. In the west and north-west
towered the Blue Mountains.</p>

<p>We descended the bluff, followed down the Boisais
three or four miles, and crossed the river into an encampment
of Snake fishermen.<a name="FNanchor_200" id="FNanchor_200"></a><a href="#Footnote_200" class="fnanchor">[200]</a> They were employed in laying
in their winter store of salmon. Many horses were
feeding on the plain. We turned ours loose also for a bite
of the fresh {108} grass, while we bought fish, &amp;c., and
made other arrangements to improve digestion and our
speed in travelling. Our business was transacted as follows:&mdash;For
one large fish-hook we bought one salmon;
for one paper of vermillion, six bunches of spawn; for
one butcher-knife, one leathern fish rope. Carbo exchanged
horses; disposed of one worth five shillings for
one worth three, and gave a blanket and ten loads of
ammunition to boot. He was vastly pleased with his
bargain, and endeavoured to show himself so, by trying
to grin like a white man; but he was not skilled in the
science of manufacturing laughter, and made a deplorable
failure of it. One of my own horses, whose feet were worn
and tender, was exchanged with like profit to the shrewd
jockeys.</p>

<p>These Indians are more filthy than the Hottentots.
Both sexes were nearly naked. Their shelters were made
with rush mats wrapped around cones of poles.</p>

<p>Having finished our trading, we travelled about ten miles
down the stream, and encamped upon its bank. The
plains were well covered with grass; many portions
seemed susceptible of cultivation. The bed of {109} the
river presented the usual characteristics of a mountain
torrent; broad, shallow, with extensive bars of coarse
gravel crossing the channel in all directions. The water<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[Pg 317]</a></span>
limpid, and its quantity might be expressed by saying that
the average depth was six inches, width ten yards, rate
of current three miles an hour. In the month of June,
however, it is said to bring from its maternal mountains
immense floods.</p>

<p>13th. A breakfast of boiled spawn, and on trail at sunrise;
travelled rapidly down the grassy intervales of
Boisais; passed many small groves of timber. Many
Indians employed in drying salmon, nearly naked, and
dirty and miserable, ran after us for tobacco, and to drive
a bargain for horses. All Indians have a mania for barter.
They will trade for good or evil to themselves, at every
opportunity. Here they beset us on every side. And if
at any moment we began to felicitate ourselves on having
at last escaped from their annoying petitions for "shmoke"
and "hos," the next moment the air would resound with
whips and hoofs, and "shmoke, shmoke," "hos," from
half a dozen new applicants, more troublesome than their
predecessors. No Jew, with old clothes and a pinch-beck
watch to sell, ever {110} pressed customers with more assiduity
than did these savages. But when we had travelled
about thirty miles from our night camp, they all suddenly
disappeared; and neither hut nor Shoshonie was seen
more. They dare not pass the boundary between themselves
and the Bonaks.</p>

<p>Soon after being relieved from these pests, our guide,
Carbo, intimated that it would be according to the rules
of etiquette in that country for him to leave us, unacquainted
though we were with the right trail among the
ten thousand that crossed the country in every direction,
and proceed to Fort Boisais, to make the important announcement
that four white faces were approaching the
post. I remonstrated; but remonstrance was mere air
in comparison with the importance of doing his duty in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[Pg 318]</a></span>
the most approved style; and away he shot, like an arrow
from the bows of his tribe, over hillock and through the
streams and copses, till lost from view. It was about four
o'clock. The trails were so numerous, that we found it
useless to continue on any of them. For if we selected
any single one, that one branched into many every half
mile. Thus we deemed it best to 'take our course,' as
the {111} mariner would say, and disregard them altogether.
In following this determination, we crossed the Boisais
again and again; floundered in quagmires, and dodged
along among whipping boughs and underbrush; and,
when unimpeded by such obstacles, pelted the dusty plain
with as sturdy a trot as ever echoed there, till the sun
went down, and his twilight had left the sky. No Fort
yet! nor had we yet seen the Saptin. We halted, held a
council, and determined to "hold our course" westward;
listened&mdash;heard nothing but the muttering Boisais, and
travelled on. In half an hour, came to us a frightful,
mournful yell, which brought us to an instantaneous halt.
We were within fifty yards of the Bonak Indians, and were
discovered!</p>

<p>This tribe is fierce, warlike, and athletic, inhabiting the
banks of that part of Saptin, or Snake River, which lies
between the mouth of Boisais, or Reed's River, and the
Blue Mountains.<a name="FNanchor_201" id="FNanchor_201"></a><a href="#Footnote_201" class="fnanchor">[201]</a> They make war upon the Blackfeet
and Crows; and for that purpose often cross the mountains,
through a gap between the track of Lewis and
Clarke and the 'Great Gap.'<a name="FNanchor_202" id="FNanchor_202"></a><a href="#Footnote_202" class="fnanchor">[202]</a> By these wars, their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[Pg 319]</a></span>number has been much reduced. They are said to speak
a language peculiar to themselves; {112} and are regarded
by the whites as a treacherous and dangerous race. We
had approached so near their camp, that whatever might
be their disposition toward us, it was impossible to retreat.
Darkness concealed the surrounding country, and hid
the river and the trails. We could not escape without
their permission and aid.</p>

<p>Our young Swiss trapper was the very man to grapple
the dilemma. He bribed their good will and their safe
conduct to the Fort. Five or six of them quickly seized
horses, and, mounting without saddle or bridle, led the
way. While these things were being done, horrid wails
came from their huts among the bushes; and those
who were with us responded to them. The only word
uttered was one, which sounded like 'yap.' This they
spoke at first in a low, plaintive key, and slowly; and then,
on a higher note and rapidly, as if under stronger emotions
of grief; and then fell away again to the low plaint of
desponding sorrow. I noticed, as we rode along, that
the tails of many of their horses were shorn of the hair in
the most uncouth manner. The manes also were miserably
haggled. The men who rode them wept, and at
intervals wailed.</p>

<p>I was afterwards informed that their tribe {113} was
mourning the death of some of their number who had lately
died; and that it is a custom with them and other western
tribes, on the death of friends, in war or by disease, for all
the surviving relatives to shear the manes and tails of their
horses to the skin&mdash;kill all the animals of the deceased&mdash;pile
all his personal property around his burial-place,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[Pg 320]</a></span>and mourn, in the manner I have described, for several
days. Their camp was eight miles south of Fort Boisais.</p>

<p>We rode the distance in three quarters of an hour.
Other Bonak horsemen joined us along the way. Each
one, as he overtook us, uttered the wail; and then one and
another took it up and bore it along the scattered line
of the cavalcade. It was not very dark&mdash;but it was night,
and all its air was filled with these expressions of savage
grief. Tears flowed, and sobs arrested oftentimes the
wail half spoken. The sympathy of the poor creatures
for each other appeared very sincere, and afforded strong
inducement to doubt the correctness of the usually received
opinion that the American Indians possess little of the
social affections. They certainly manifested enough on
this occasion to render the hour I passed with them more
oppressively painful than I hope ever again to experience.</p>

<p>{114} Mr. Payette, the person in charge at Boisais,
received us with every mark of kindness; gave our horses
to the care of his servants, and introduced us immediately
to the chairs, table and edibles of his apartments. He
is a French Canadian; has been in the service of the Hudson's
Bay Company more than twenty years, and holds
the rank of clerk; is a merry, fat old gentleman of fifty,
who, although in the wilderness all the best years of his
life, has retained that manner of benevolence in trifles, in
his mode of address, of seating you and serving you at
table, of directing your attention continually to some little
matter of interest, of making you speak the French language
'<i>parfaitement</i>' whether you are able to do so or not,
so strikingly agreeable in that mercurial people. The
14th and 15th were spent very pleasantly with this gentleman.
During that time he feasted us with excellent bread,
and butter made from an American cow, obtained from
some of the missionaries; with baked, boiled, fried and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[Pg 321]</a></span>
broiled salmon&mdash;and, at my request, with some of his
adventures in the wilderness.</p>

<p>Fort Boisais was established in 1832, as the post whence
to oppose Wyeth's operations at Fort Hall.<a name="FNanchor_203" id="FNanchor_203"></a><a href="#Footnote_203" class="fnanchor">[203]</a> From it,
the Hudson's Bay Company sent their trading parties over
{115} the country south, in advance and rear and around
every movement of Wyeth. And by using liberally the
fund laid by annually for that purpose, they undersold
the American till he was forced from the country.</p>

<p>On the part of the Hudson's Bay Company, I see nothing
strange or unmanly in this conduct, if looked at as a
business transaction. People having equal rights in trade,
assume necessarily the relative positions which their skill
and capital can command. This is the position of Americans
and Britons in Oregon. By a pusillanimous policy
on the part of the American Government, we have given
British subjects an equal right with our own citizens to
trade in all that part of the Public Domain lying west of
the Rocky Mountains. In the exercise of the rights thus
granted, the Hudson's Bay Company employ their incomparable
ingenuity and immense wealth in driving every
American trader from the coasts of the North Pacific.
And who is to be blamed for this? The Government of
the United States, that has, through want of wisdom or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[Pg 322]</a></span>
firmness or justice, permitted these important rights of its
citizens to be monopolized by foreign capitalists for the
last thirty years.</p>

<p>This fort stands on the eastern bank of {116} the Saptin,
eight miles north of the mouth of Boisais or Reed's river.
It consists of a parallelogram about one hundred feet
square, surrounded by a stockade of poles about fifteen
feet in height. It was entered on the west side. Across
the area north and south runs the principal building. It
is constructed of logs, and contains a large dining room,
a sleeping apartment and kitchen. On the north side of
the area, in front of this, is the store; on the south side
the dwellings of the servants; back of the main building,
an outdoor oven; and in the north-east corner of the
stockade is the bastion. This was Fort Boisais in 1839.
Mons. Payette was erecting a neat adobie wall around it.
He expected soon to be able to tear away the old stockade,
and before this has doubtless done so.<a name="FNanchor_204" id="FNanchor_204"></a><a href="#Footnote_204" class="fnanchor">[204]</a></p>

<p>Among the curiosities of this establishment were the
fore wheels, axletree and thills of a one-horse waggon, said
to have been run by the American missionaries from the
State of Connecticut through the mountains thus far
toward the mouth of the Columbia. It was left here under
the belief that it could not be taken through the Blue
Mountains. But fortunately for the next that shall attempt
to cross the continent, {117} a safe and easy passage has
lately been discovered by which vehicles of the kind may
be drawn through to Wallawalla.<a name="FNanchor_205" id="FNanchor_205"></a><a href="#Footnote_205" class="fnanchor">[205]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[Pg 323]</a></span></p>

<p>At ten o'clock on the 16th we found ourselves sufficiently
rested to recommence our journey. Our packs and ourselves
were sent across the Saptin in a canoe; and our
horses having swam it, and having been packed and saddled
firmly for a rapid march, and a '<i>bon jour</i>' having
been returned by Mons. Payette, with the additional kind
wish of a '<i>bon voyage</i>' to us, over the mountains, we left
the old gentleman to his solitary dominion.</p>

<p>He usually collects, during the twelvemonth, twelve
or fifteen packs of beaver, and employs himself in the salmon
season in curing large quantities of that fish for the
supply of other posts. Our course was down the west
bank of the river. The soil was sand and clay mixed in
nearly equal proportions. Its composition is such as to
render it fruitful; but the absence of dews and rains forbids
the expectation that it will ever be so. Vegetation,
bunch-grass and wild wormwood. Travelled fifteen miles
and encamped near a small bute, at the foot of which
ran a little tributary of the Saptin. From the south bank
of this {118} stream near our camp burst a great number
of hot springs. Water impregnated with sulphur: temperature
at the boiling point.<a name="FNanchor_206" id="FNanchor_206"></a><a href="#Footnote_206" class="fnanchor">[206]</a></p>

<p>17th. Soil as on the track of the 16th, save that the
hills became higher and more gravelly. In the after<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[Pg 324]</a></span>noon,
crossed a brook putting into the Saptin. At mid-day,
touched the Saptin, and left it again for the hills.
Mid-afternoon, struck another small stream, and followed
up its valley till night.<a name="FNanchor_207" id="FNanchor_207"></a><a href="#Footnote_207" class="fnanchor">[207]</a> Estimated our day's journey
at thirty miles.</p>

<p>18th. The hills higher and more rocky; those in the
distance to the west and north-west partially covered
with pines and cedars. Immediately around our track,
the hills were clothed with dry bunch grass. Some of them
had been burnt by the Indians. Many beautiful little
valleys were seen among the highlands. Black birch,
rose, and willow shrubs, and quaking-asp trees on the
banks of the little brooks. Encamped under the cliffs
of a bute. The moon was in the first quarter. Its cold
beams harmonized well with the chilling winds of the
mountains. The atmosphere all the day smoky, as in
Indian summertime in the highlands of New England.
Estimated distance travelled, twenty-five miles.</p>

<p>{119} 19th. Forenoon, over gently rising conical hills,
clothed with bunch grass; soil in the valleys sand and
clay. Cooked dinner at L'Arbor Seul, a lonely pine in an
extensive plain.<a name="FNanchor_208" id="FNanchor_208"></a><a href="#Footnote_208" class="fnanchor">[208]</a> Encamped at night on a stream coming
from the Blue Mountains, in the north-west. Distance
to-day, thirty miles.</p>

<p>20th. Track up the valley in which we encamped the
preceding night, over gently undulating hills; high broken
mountains on either side. About twelve o'clock, came
to a very steep descent, a mile in length. The upper part
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[Pg 325]</a></span>of it was so precipitous that the animals with packs were
obliged to make a zigzag track of a mile, to descend the
half that distance; the lower part was less precipitous,
but covered with loose volcanic rocks. Among these the
horses plunged and bruised themselves badly; but fortunately
none were seriously injured. Some rich soil in the
valleys; heavy groves of yellow pine, spruce, and hemlock;
quaking-asp on the streams, and in the ravines.
From high swells, over which ran the trail, we saw an extensive
valley, deeply sunken among the lofty mountains in
the north-east. It appeared to be thickly coated with
grass, some portions dry, others green. The {120} meadow
lark made its appearance to-day. Towards night, we
came again into the valley which we had entered at mid-day,
and encamped under a majestic yellow pine.<a name="FNanchor_209" id="FNanchor_209"></a><a href="#Footnote_209" class="fnanchor">[209]</a> Freezing
breezes swept down from the woody mountain around
us, and made our fire, blazing high under the dark groaning
boughs, extremely agreeable. Travelled twenty-five
miles.</p>

<p>21st. A day of severe travelling. In the forenoon,
the trail ran over a series of mountains swelling one above
another in long and gentle ascents, covered with noble
forests of yellow pine, fir, and hemlock. Among these
were frequent glades of rich pasture land; grass green,
and numerous brooks of pure water leaping from the cliffs,
or murmuring among the shrubbery. The snow-ball,
the wax plant, the yellow and black currant&mdash;a species
of whortleberry&mdash;the service berry&mdash;choke cherry&mdash;the
elder&mdash;the shrub maple&mdash;and all the beautiful flowers
that gem a mountain landscape during its short summer,
clothed the ground. At twelve o'clock, we entered a deep
ravine, at the bottom of which ran a brook of sweet clear
water; we dined on its bank. A dish of rich cocoa, mush,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[Pg 326]</a></span>
and sugar, and dried buffalo tongue, on the {121} fresh
grass, by a cool rivulet on the wild mountains of Oregon!
Nature stretched her bare and mighty arms around us!
The mountains hid the lower sky, and walled out the lower
world! We looked upon the beautiful heights of the Blue
Mountains, and ate among its spring blossoms, its singing
pines, and holy battlements, ten thousand feet above the
seas.</p>

<p>In the afternoon, we continued to ascend; vast rolls
lifted themselves over one another, in a northerly direction,
higher and higher, till in the distance their tops mingled
with the blue of the sky. We followed this grassy ridge
till near four o'clock, when we commenced descending.
A mile over slowly declining hills, and then the descent
became frightful. It appeared to stand 45&deg; to the plane
of the horizon. The horses, when they turned at the
angles of the zigzag trail, often found the greatest difficulty
to keep on their feet. Two miles of such descent, of
bracing with might and main, deposited us in a ravine
of great depth, hung far and near with cliffs and abrupt
earthy borders, partially covered with pines. At the bottom
a brook running in a northerly direction, struggled
and roared among the fallen rocks. We {122} made our
way with much difficulty down its banks a short distance,
crossed it, and proceeding in a north-westerly direction
to another stream flowing eastward, encamped among the
pines. These valleys were filled with cold winds, which
rushed through them in irregular gusts, chilling every thing
they touched. We set fire to large piles of dry pine logs
in camp, spread our couches, and wayworn as men ever
were, ensconced ourselves in them for repose. Carbo
did not retire; but went whistling about among the horses;
untied his wallet of provisions, and ate a second time,
punched the fire, and looked at the eastern sky with evi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[Pg 327]</a></span>dent
interest. The vales below had been set on fire by
Indians; and I more than half supposed that he expected
to see some of his tribe at our quarters. But my supposition
was groundless.</p>

<p>As soon as the moon peeped over the eastern heights,
he roused me to hear in broken French that our horses
had nothing to eat in the place where they were; and that
we, being rested, must climb the mountain to find food for
them. No proposition, and the facts brought to urge its
adoption, could have been more unfortunately reasonable
and true&mdash;at that particular {123} time. My first impulse
was to order him to his couch; but a hungry whinny
from my roan pony, browsing near me, awakened me fully
to the propriety of the measure proposed. I, therefore,
summoned my weary limbs and bruised and ulcered feet,
to their best efforts, and at twelve o'clock at night we were
on march.</p>

<p>For some time we led our animals through the tangled
wood, and then along a steep gravelly side of the chasm,
where the foothold slipped at every step; awhile among
rolling stones so thickly strewn upon the ground, that the
horses touched it only when their weight drove their feet
down between them; and then, awhile we seemed to hang
on the cliffs, and pause between advancing and following
the laws of gravitation to the bed of the torrent that battled
its way in the caverns far below; and in the desperation
of a last effort, climbed the bank to a place of safety.
At length we arrived at a large indentation in the face of
the mountain, up the encircling rim of which, the trail for
half a mile was of comparatively easy ascent. At the end
of this distance, another difficulty was superadded to all
we had yet experienced.</p>

<p>The steeps were covered to the depth of {124} several feet
with "cut rock"&mdash;dark shining cubes from one to three<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[Pg 328]</a></span>
inches in diameter, with sharp corners and edges. It was
well nigh impossible to force our horses on them. The
most obedient one, however, was at length led and scourged
upon them; and by repeating the same inflictions, the
remainder were finally induced to follow. All walked
except Smith. His horse was "a d&mdash;d brute, and was
made to carry him or die."</p>

<p>The poor animals would slip, and gather, and cripple;
and when unable longer to endure the cutting stone under
their feet, would suddenly drop on their knee; but the
pain caused by that position would soon force them to rise
again, and struggle up the ascent. An half hour of such
travelling conducted us over this stony surface to the
smooth grassy swells, the surface of which was pleasant
to the lacerated feet of our horses. The green grass grew
thickly all around. The moon poured her bright beams
through the frosty air on the slumbering heights; in the
deep pine-clad vales dimly burned the Indian fires; from
mountain to mountain sounded the deep bass of a thousand
cascades.<a name="FNanchor_210" id="FNanchor_210"></a><a href="#Footnote_210" class="fnanchor">[210]</a></p>

<p>We encamped in a grove of pines which {125} crowned
the mountain, at three o'clock in the morning.</p>

<p>22nd. We saddled early, and ascending for two hours
a line of gentle grassy elevations, came to the beginning
of the north-western declivities of the Blue Mountains.
The trail ran down the ravines of small brooks flowing
north-west, and occasionally over high swells which stretched
down the plain that lies about the south-western branches
of the Wallawalla River: we halted to dine.<a name="FNanchor_211" id="FNanchor_211"></a><a href="#Footnote_211" class="fnanchor">[211]</a> In the
afternoon we struck off north-westerly over the rolling
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[Pg 329]</a></span>plain. The soil in the depressions was a light and loose
compound of sand and clay, and thinly covered with
bunch grass. The swells were of gravel, and generally
barren; trees on the brooks only, and these few, small and
of little value.</p>

<p>About three o'clock we came into the camp of a middle-aged
Skyuse Indian,<a name="FNanchor_212" id="FNanchor_212"></a><a href="#Footnote_212" class="fnanchor">[212]</a> who was on his onward march
from the buffalo hunt in the mountain valleys east and
north-east of Fort Hall. He was a spare man of five feet
eight inches, dressed in a green camlet frock-coat, a black
vest, striped cotton shirt, leather pants, moccasins, and a
white felt hat. There were two children, boys, neatly clad
in deer-skin. His {126} camp equipage was very comfortable&mdash;four
or five camp-kettles with tin covers, a
number of pails with covers, a leathern tent, and an assortment
of fine buffalo robes. He had had a very successful
hunt. Of the seventeen horses in his caravan, six were
loaded with the best flesh of the buffalo cow, cured in the
best manner; two others bore his tent, utensils, clothing,
robes, &amp;c.; four others were ridden by himself and
family; the five remaining were used to relieve those
that, from time to time, might tire. These were splendid
animals, as large as the best horses of the States, well
knit, deep and wide at the shoulders; a broad loin, and
very small lower limbs and feet; of extreme activity and
capacity for endurance.</p>

<p>Learning that this Indian was proceeding to Dr. Whitman's
mission establishment, where a considerable number
of his tribe had pitched their tents for the approaching
winter, I determined to leave the cavalcade and accompany
him there. My guide Carbo, therefore, having explained
my intentions to my new acquaintance, departed with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[Pg 330]</a></span>
remainder of his charge for Fort Wallawalla.<a name="FNanchor_213" id="FNanchor_213"></a><a href="#Footnote_213" class="fnanchor">[213]</a> Crickie,
(in English "poor crane,") was a very kind man.</p>

<p>{127} Immediately after the departure of Carbo and
company, he turned my worn-out animals loose, and loaded
my packs upon his own, gave me a splendid saddle-horse
to ride, and intimated by significant gestures that we
would go a short distance that afternoon, in order to arrive
at the mission early the next day. I gave my assent,
and we were soon on the way. Our course was north-easterly
over sharp swells, among which ran many clear
and beautiful brooks; soil gravel, loam, sand and clay, and
well covered with dry bunch grass, incapable of producing
the grains without irrigation. The swells and streams run
north-westerly from the Blue Mountains. Our course was
diagonally across them.</p>

<p>Having made about ten miles at sunset, we encamped
for the night. I noticed, during the drive, a degree of
forbearance towards each other, in this family of savages
which I had never before observed in that race. When
we halted for the night the two boys were behind. They
had been frolicking with their horses, and as the darkness
came on, lost the trail. It was a half-hour before they
made their appearance, and during this time, the worthy
parents exhibited the most affectionate solicitude {128} for
them. One of them was but three years old, and was
lashed to the horse he rode; the other only seven years of
age. Young pilots in the wilderness at night! But the
elder, true to the sagacity of his race, had taken his
course, and struck the brook on which we had encamped,
within three hundred yards of us. The pride of the parents
at this feat, and their ardent attachment to their
children, were perceptible in the pleasure with which they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[Pg 331]</a></span>
received them at their evening fire, and heard the relation
of their childish adventure.</p>

<p>The weather was so pleasant that no tent was pitched.
The willows were beat, and buffalo robes spread over
them. Underneath were laid other robes, on which my
Indian host seated himself with his wife and children on
one side, and myself on the other. A fire burned brightly
in front. Water was brought, and the evening ablutions
having been performed, the wife presented a dish of meat
to her husband, and one to myself. There was a pause.
The woman seated herself between her children. The
Indian then bowed his head and prayed to God! A wandering
savage in Oregon calling upon Jehovah in the name
of Jesus {129} Christ! After the prayer, he gave meat
to his children, and passed the dish to his wife.</p>

<p>While eating, the frequent repetition of the words Jehovah
and Jesus Christ, in the most reverential manner, led
me to suppose they were conversing on religious topics;
and thus they passed an hour. Meanwhile, the exceeding
weariness of a long day's travel admonished me to
seek rest.</p>

<p>I had slumbered, I know not how long, when a strain
of music awoke me. I was about rising to ascertain
whether the sweet notes of Tallis's Chant came to these
solitudes from earth or sky, when a full recollection of
my situation, and of the religious habits of my host, easily
solved the rising inquiry, and induced me to observe
instead of disturbing. The Indian family was engaged
in its evening devotions. They were singing a hymn in
the Nez Perc&eacute;s language. Having finished it, they all
knelt and bowed their faces upon the buffalo robes, and
Crickie prayed long and fervently. Afterwards they sang
another hymn and retired. This was the first breathing
of religious feelings that I had seen since leaving the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[Pg 332]</a></span>
States. A pleasant evidence that the Oregon wilderness
was beginning to bear the rose of Sharon {130} on its
thousand hills, and that on the barren soil of the Skyuse
heart was beginning to bud and blossom and ripen the
golden fruits of faith in Jehovah, and hope in an after-state.</p>

<p>23rd. We were on our way before the sun rose. The
dawn on an Oregon sky, the rich blue embankment of
mountains over which the great day-star raised his glowing
rim, the blandness of the air, the lively ambling of
the caravan towards the neighbouring abode of my countrymen,
imparted to my mind and body a most agreeable
exhilaration. Crickie, and his wife and children also,
appeared to enjoy the atmosphere and scenery of their
native valley; and we went on together merrily over the
swelling plains and murmuring streams till about eight
o'clock, when Crickie spurred his horse in advance of the
cavalcade, and motioned me to follow him.</p>

<p>We rode very rapidly for about three hours over a
country gently undulating, well set with bunch grass, and
intersected with small streams flowing north-west. The
dust had risen in dark clouds during our ride, and rendered
it necessary to bathe before presenting ourselves at
the mission. We therefore halted on the bank of a little
brook {131} overhung with willows, and proceeded to
make our toilet. Crickie's paraphernalia was ample for
the purpose, and showed that among his other excellencies,
cleanliness held a prominent place. A small mirror,
pocket-comb, soap and a towel, were immediately
produced; and the dust was taken from his person
and wardrobe with a nicety that would have satisfied a
town exquisite.</p>

<p>A ride of five miles afterward brought us in sight of the
groves around the mission. The plains far and near were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[Pg 333]</a></span>
dry and brown. Every form of vegetation was dead save
the forest trees, whose roots drank deeply of the waters
of the stream. We crossed the river, passed the Indian
encampment hard by, and were at the gate of the mission
fields in presence of Dr. Whitman. He was speaking
Skyuse at the top of his voice to some lazy Indians who
were driving their cattle from his garden, and giving orders
to others to yoke their oxen, get the axes, and go into the
forest for the lower sleepers of the new mission house.<a name="FNanchor_214" id="FNanchor_214"></a><a href="#Footnote_214" class="fnanchor">[214]</a>
Mr. Hall, printer at the Sandwich Islands, soon appeared
in working dress, with an axe on his shoulder; next came
Mr. Monger, pulling the pine shavings from his fore-plane.<a name="FNanchor_215" id="FNanchor_215"></a><a href="#Footnote_215" class="fnanchor">[215]</a>
All seemed desirous to {132} ask me how long a
balloon line had been running between the States and the
Pacific, by which single individuals crossed the continent.
The oxen, however, were yoked, and axes glistening in
the sun, and there was no time to spend, if they would
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[Pg 334]</a></span>return from their labour before nightfall. So that the
whence and wherefore of my sudden appearance among
them, were left for an after explanation. The doctor
introduced me to his excellent lady, and departed to his
labour.<a name="FNanchor_216" id="FNanchor_216"></a><a href="#Footnote_216" class="fnanchor">[216]</a></p>

<p>The afternoon was spent in listless rest from the toils
of my journey. At sunset, however, I strolled out and
took a bird's-eye view of the plantation and plain of the
Wallawalla. The old mission-house stands on the north-east
bank of the river, about four rods from the water-side,
at the north-east corner of an enclosure containing
about two hundred and fifty acres; two hundred of which
are under good cultivation. The soil is a thin stratum
of clay, mixed with sand and a small proportion of vegetable
mould, resting on a base of coarse gravel. Through
this gravel, water from the Wallawalla filtrates, and by
capillary attraction is raised to the roots of vegetation in
the incumbent earth. The products are wheat, {133} Indian
corn, onions, turnips, ruta-baga, water, musk and nutmeg
melons, squashes, asparagus, tomatoes, cucumbers,
peas, &amp;c., in the garden&mdash;all of good quality, and
abundant crops.</p>

<p>The Wallawalla is a pretty stream. Its channel is paved
with gravel and sand, and about three rods in width; water
two feet deep, running five or six miles the hour, and limpid
and cool through the year. A hundred yards below the
house, it makes a beautiful bend to the south-west for a
short distance, and then resumes its general direction of
north-west by north, along the border of the plantation.
On the opposite bank is a line of timber and underwood,
interlaced with flowering brambles. Other small groves
occur above and below along the banks.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[Pg 335]</a></span></p>
<p>The plain about the waters of this river is about thirty
miles square. A great part of this surface is more or less
covered with bunch grass. The branches of the river are
distributed over it in such manner that most of it can be
grazed. But, from what came under my own observation,
and the information received from respectable American
citizens, who had examined it more minutely than I
had time to do, I suppose {134} there to be scarcely two
thousand acres of this vast extent of surface, which can
ever be made available for the purposes of cultivation.
The absence of rains and dews in the season of crops, and
the impossibility of irrigating much of it on account of the
height of the general surface above the streams, will afford
sufficient reasons for entertaining this opinion.</p>

<p>The doctor returned near night with his timber, one elm
and a number of quaking-asp sticks; and appeared gratified
that he had been able to find the requisite number
of sufficient size to support his floor. Tea came on, and
passed away in earnest conversation about native land
and friends left there&mdash;of the pleasure they derived from
their present occupation&mdash;and the trials that befell them
while commencing the mission and afterwards.</p>

<p>Among the latter, was mentioned the drowning of their
child in the Wallawalla the year before, a little girl two
years old. She fell into the river at the place where they
took water for family use. The mother was in the house,
the father a short distance away on the premises. The
alarm was conveyed to them almost instantly, and they
and others rushed to the stream, and sought {135} for
their child with frantic eagerness. But the strong heavy
current had carried it down and lodged it in a clump of
bushes under the bank on which they stood. They passed
the spot where it lay, but found it too late. Thus these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[Pg 336]</a></span>
devoted people were bereft, in the most afflicting manner,
of their only child&mdash;left alone in the wilderness.<a name="FNanchor_217" id="FNanchor_217"></a><a href="#Footnote_217" class="fnanchor">[217]</a></p>

<p>The morning of the 24th opened in the loveliest hues
of the sky. Still none of the beauty of the harvest field&mdash;none
of the fragrance of the ripened fruits of autumn were
there. The wild horses were frolicking on the plains;
but the plains smoked with dust and dearth. The green
woods and the streams sent up their harmonies with
the breeze; but it was like a dirge over the remains of the
departed glories of the year. And yet when the smoking
vegetables, the hissing steak, bread white as snow, and
the newly-churned golden butter graced the breakfast
table, and the happy countenances of countrymen and
countrywomen shone around, I could with difficulty believe
myself in a country so far distant from, and so unlike
my native land, in all its features. But during breakfast,
this pleasant illusion was dispelled by one of the causes
which induced it.</p>

<p>{136} Our steak was of horse-flesh! On such meat this
poor family subsist most of the time. They do not complain.
It enables them to exist to do the Indian good,
and thus satisfies them.<a name="FNanchor_218" id="FNanchor_218"></a><a href="#Footnote_218" class="fnanchor">[218]</a> But can it satisfy those who
give money for the support of missionaries, that the allowance
made by their agents for the support of those who
abandon parents and freedom and home, and surrender
not only themselves to the mercy of the savages, but their
offspring also, should be so meagre, as to compel them to
eat horse-flesh! This necessity existed in 1839, at the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[Pg 337]</a></span>mission on the Wallawalla, and I doubt not exists in 1843.</p>

<p>The breakfast being over, the doctor invited me to a
stroll over his premises. The garden was first examined; its
location, on the curving bank of the Wallawalla; the apple
trees, growing thriftily on its western border; the beautiful
tomato and other vegetables, burdening the grounds.
Next to the fields. The doctor's views of the soil, and
its mode of receiving moisture from the river, were such
as I have previously expressed. "For," said he, "in those
places where you perceive the stratum of gravel to be
raised so as to interrupt the capillary attraction of the
superincumbent earth, the {137} crop failed." Then to
the new house. The adobie walls had been erected a year.
These were about forty feet by twenty, and one and a
half stories high. The interior area consisted of two parlours
of the ordinary size, separated by an adobie portion.
The outer door opened into one of them; and
from this a door in the partition led to the other. Above
were to be sleeping apartments. To the main building
was attached another of equal height designed for a kitchen,
with chambers above for servants. Mr. Monger and a
Sandwich Islander were laying the floors, making the
doors, &amp;c.</p>

<p>The lumber used was a very superior quality of yellow
pine plank, which Dr. Whitman had cut with a whip saw
among the blue mountains, fifteen miles distant. Next
to the "caral." A fine yoke of oxen, two cows, an American
bull, and the beginning of a stock of hogs were thereabout.
And last to the grist-mill on the other side of the
river. It consisted of a spherical wrought iron burr four
or five inches in diameter, surrounded by a counter-burred
surface of the same material. The spherical burr was
permanently attached to the shaft of a horizontal water-wheel.
The surrounding burred surface was firmly fas<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[Pg 338]</a></span>tened
to {138} timbers, in such a position that when the
water-wheel was put in motion, the operation of the mill
was similar to that of a coffee-mill. It was a crazy thing,
but for it the doctor was grateful.</p>

<p>It would, with the help of himself and an Indian, grind
enough in a day to feed his family a week, and that was
better than to beat it with a pestle and mortar. It
appeared to me quite remarkable that the doctor could
have made so many improvements since the year 1834.
But the industry which crowded every hour of the day,
his untiring energy of character, and the very efficient aid
of his wife in relieving him in a great degree from the
labours of the school, are, perhaps, circumstances which
will render possibility probable, that in five years one man
without funds for such purposes, without other aid in that
business than that of a fellow missionary at short intervals,
should fence, plough, build, plant an orchard, and
do all the other laborious acts of opening a plantation on
the face of that distant wilderness; learn an Indian
language and do the duties, meanwhile, of a physician to
the associate stations on the Clear Water and Spokan.<a name="FNanchor_219" id="FNanchor_219"></a><a href="#Footnote_219" class="fnanchor">[219]</a></p>

<p>In the afternoon, Dr. Whitman and his {139} lady
assembled the Indians for instruction in reading. Forty or
fifty children between the ages of seven and eighteen, and
several other people gathered on the shady side of the new
mission-house at the ringing of a hand-bell, and seated
themselves in an orderly manner on wooden benches. The
doctor then wrote monosyllables, words, and instructive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[Pg 339]</a></span>
sentences in the Nez Perc&eacute;s language, on a large blackboard
suspended on the wall, and proceeded first to teach
the nature and power of the letters in representing the
simple sounds of the language, and then the construction
of words and their uses in forming sentences expressive
of thought. The sentences written during these operations
were at last read, syllable by syllable, and word
after word, and explained until the sentiments contained
in them were comprehended; and it was delightful to
notice the undisguised avidity with which these people
would devour a new idea. It seemed to produce a thrill
of delight that kindled up the countenance and animated
the whole frame. A hymn in the Nez Perc&eacute;s language,
learned by rote from their teachers, was then sung, and
the exercises closed with prayer by Dr. Whitman in the
same tongue.</p>

<p>{140} 25th. I was awakened at early dawn by the merry
sounds of clapping boards, the hammer, the axe and the
plane; the sweet melodies of the parent of virtue, at this
cradle of civilization. When I rose everything was in
motion. Dr. Whitman's little herd was lowing in the
river; the wild horses were neighing at the morning
breeze; the birds were caroling in the groves. I said,
every thing was alive. Nay, not so. The Skyuse village
was in the deepest slumber, save a few solitary individuals
who were stalking with slow and stately tread up a neighbouring
bute, to descry the retreat of their animals. Their
conical skin lodges dotted the valley above the mission,
and imparted to the morning landscape a peculiar wildness.
As the sun rose, the inmates began to emerge from
them.</p>

<p>It was a chilly hour; and their buffalo robes were
drawn over their shoulders, with the hair next the body.
The snow-white flesh side was fringed with the dark fur<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[Pg 340]</a></span>
that crept in sight around the edges, and their own long
black glistening tresses fell over it far down the back. The
children were out in all the buoyancy of young life, shouting
to the prancing steed, or betting gravel stones that
the arrows upon their little {141} bows would be the first
to clip the sturdy thistle head upon which they were waging
mimic war. The women were busy at their fires, weaving
mats from the flag; or sewing moccasins, leggings, or
hunting shirts. Crickie was giving meat to his friends,
who the past winter had fed him, and taken care of him,
while lying sick.</p>

<p>This is the imperial tribe of Oregon. They formerly
claimed a prescriptive right to exercise jurisdiction over
the country down the Columbia to its mouth; and up
the North and South Forks to their sources. In the
reign of the late high Chief, the brother of him who now
holds that station, this claim was acceded to by all the
tribes within those districts. But that talented and brave
man left at his death but one son, who, after receiving
a thorough education at the Selkirk settlement on Red
River of Lake Winnipeg, also died&mdash;and with him the
imperial dignity of the Skyuse tribe.<a name="FNanchor_220" id="FNanchor_220"></a><a href="#Footnote_220" class="fnanchor">[220]</a></p>

<p>The person in charge at Fort Wallawalla, indeed dressed
the present incumbent in better style than his fellows;
proclaimed him high chief, and by treating him with the
formality usually tendered to his deceased brother, has
obtained for him the {142} name, but not the respect and
influence belonging to the office. He is a man of considerable
mental power, but has none of the fire and energy
attributed to his predecessor. The Wallawallas and Upper<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[Pg 341]</a></span>
Chinooks are the only tribes that continue to recognise the
Skyuse supremacy.</p>

<p>The Skyuse are also a tribe of merchants. Before the
establishment of Forts Hall and Boisais, they were in the
habit of rendezvousing at "La Grande Rounde," an extensive
valley in the Blue Mountains, with the Shoshonies
and other Indians from the Saptin, and exchanging with
them their horses for furs, buffalo robes, skin tents, &amp;c.
But since the building of these posts, that portion of their
trade is nearly destroyed. In the winter season, a band
of them usually descends to the Dalles, barters with the
Chinooks for salmon, and holds councils over that mean
and miserable band to ascertain their misdemeanors, and
punish them therefore by whipping. The Wallawallas,
however, are their most numerous and profitable customers.
They may well be termed the fishermen of the
Skyuse camp. They live on both banks of the Columbia,
from the Blue Mountains to the Dalles, and employ themselves
principally {143} in taking salmon. For these, their
betters, who consider fishing a menial business, give them
horses. They own large numbers of these animals. A
Skyuse is thought to be poor who has but fifteen or twenty
of them. They generally have many more. One fat,
hearty old fellow, owns something more than two thousand;
all wild, except many as he needs for use or sale.</p>

<p>To these reports of the Indians, Dr. Whitman gave little
credence; so at variance were some of the facts related,
with what he presumed the Hudson's Bay Company
would permit to be done by any one in their employment,
or under their patronage&mdash;the abuse of American
citizens, and the ungentlemanly interference with their
characters and calling.</p>

<p>On the morning of the 27th, the arrival of Mr. Ermetinger,
the senior clerk at Fort Hall from Fort Wallawalla,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[Pg 342]</a></span>
created quite a sensation. His uniform kindness to the
Missionaries has endeared him to them.<a name="FNanchor_221" id="FNanchor_221"></a><a href="#Footnote_221" class="fnanchor">[221]</a> My companion,
Blair, accompanied him. The poor old man had
become lonely and discouraged, and as I had encouraged
him to expect any assistance from me which his circumstances
might demand, it afforded me the greatest pleasure
to make his merits {144} known to the Missionaries,
who needed an artisan to construct a mill at the station
on the Clear Water. Dr. Whitman contracted with him
for his services and Blair was happy. I sincerely hope
he may for ever be so.</p>

<p>I attended the Indian school to-day. Mrs. Whitman
is an indefatigable instructress. The children read in
monosyllables from a primer lately published at the Clear
Water station. After reading, they repeated a number
of hymns in the Nez Perc&eacute;s, composed by Mr. Smith, of
the Spokan station.<a name="FNanchor_222" id="FNanchor_222"></a><a href="#Footnote_222" class="fnanchor">[222]</a> These were afterwards sung. They
learn music readily. At nightfall, I visited the Indian
lodges in company with Dr. Whitman. In one of them
we saw a young woman who imagined that the spirit of a
Medicine man, or conjuror, had entered into her system,
and was wasting her life. She was resorting to the native
remedy for such evils&mdash;singing wild incantations, and
weeping loudly. This tribe, like all others west of the
mountains, believe in witchcraft under various forms&mdash;practice
sleight-of-hand, fire-eating, &amp;c. They insert rough
sticks into their throats, and draw them up and down
till the blood flows freely, to make them long-winded
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[Pg 343]</a></span>on march. They {145} flatten the head, and perforate
the septum, or partition of the nose. In this orifice they
wear various ornaments. The more common one that I
noticed was a wolf's tooth.</p>

<p>The Skyuse have two distinct languages: the one used
in ordinary intercourse, the other on extraordinary occasions;
as in war-councils, &amp;c. Both are said to be copious
and expressive. They also speak the Nez Perc&eacute;s and
Wallawalla.</p>

<p>On the 28th, Mr. Ermetinger started for Fort Hall,
and Blair for the Clear Water. Early in the day, the
Indians brought in large numbers of their horses to try
their speed. These are a fine race of animals; as large,
and of better form, and more activity than most of the
horses in the States. Every variety of colour is found
among them, from the shining coal-black to the milk-white.
Some of them are pied very singularly; for
instance, a roan body with bay ears, and white mane and
tail. Some are spotted with white on a roan, or bay, or
sorrel ground, with tail and ears tipped with black. They
are better trained to the saddle than those of civilized
countries.</p>

<p>When an Indian wishes an increase of his serving animals,
he mounts a fleet horse, {146} and, lasso in hand,
rushes into his band of wild animals, throws it upon the
neck of the chosen one, and chokes him down; and while
in a state of insensibility, ties the hind and fore feet firmly
together. When consciousness returns, the animal struggles
violently, but in vain, to get loose. His fear is then
attacked by throwing bear-skins, wolf-skins, and blankets
at his head till he becomes quiet. He is then loosened
from the cord, and rears and plunges furiously at the end
of a long rope, and receives another introduction to bear-skins,
&amp;c. After this, he is approached and handled;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[Pg 344]</a></span>
or, if still too timid, he is again beset with blankets and
bear-skins, as before, until he is docile. Then come the
saddling and riding. During this training, they uniformly
treat him tenderly when near, and rudely when he pulls
at the end of the halter. Thus they make their wild steed
the most fearless and pleasant riding animals I ever
mounted.</p>

<p>The course pursued by Mr. Whitman, and other Presbyterian
Missionaries, to improve the Indians, is to teach
them the Nez Perc&eacute;s language, according to fixed grammatical
rules, for the purpose of opening to them the arts
and religion of civilized {147} nations through the medium
of books. They also teach them practical agriculture and
the useful arts, for the purpose of civilizing their physical
condition. By these means, they hope to make them
a better and a happier people. Perhaps it would be an
easier way to the same result, if they would teach them
the English language, and thus open to them at once the
treasures which centuries of toil, by a superior race, have
dug from the mines of intelligence and truth.</p>

<p>This was the evening before the sabbath, and Dr. Whitman,
as his custom was, invited one of the most intelligent
Indians to his study, translated to him the text of scripture
from which he intended to teach the tribe on the
morrow, explained to him its doctrines, and required of
him to explain in turn. This was repeated again and
again, until the Indian obtained a clear understanding of
its doctrines.</p>

<p>The 29th was the sabbath, and I had an opportunity
of noticing its observance by the Skyuse. I rose before
the sun. The stars were waxing dim on the morning sky,
the most charming dawn I ever witnessed. Every possible
circumstance of sublimity conspired to make it so. There
was the {148} pure atmosphere; not a wisp of cloud on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[Pg 345]</a></span>
all its transparent depths. The light poured over the Blue
Mountains like a cataract of gold; first on the upper
sky, then deepening its course through the lower air, it
gilded the plain with a flood of brightness, mellow, beautiful
brightness; the charms of morning light, on the brown,
boundless solitudes of Oregon. The breeze scarcely
rustled the leaves of the dying flowers; the drumming of
the woodpecker on the distant tree, sounded a painful
discord; so grand, so awful, and yet so sweet, were the
unuttered symphonies of the sublime quiet of the wilderness.</p>

<p>At ten o'clock the Skyuse assembled for worship in the
open air. The exercises were according to the Presbyterian
form; the invocation, the hymn, the prayer, the
hymn, the sermon, a prayer, a hymn, and the blessing;
all in the Nez Perc&eacute;s tongue. The principal peculiarity
about the services was the mode of delivering the discourse.
When Dr. Whitman arose and announced the text, the
Indian who had been instructed on the previous night,
rose and repeated it; and as the address proceeded,
repeated it also by sentence or paragraph, till it was finished.
This is the custom of {149} the Skyuse in all their
public speaking. The benefit resulting from it in this
case, apparently, was the giving the doctrines which the
Doctor desired to inculcate, a clearer expression in the
proper idiom of the language.</p>

<p>During the recess, the children were assembled in sabbath
school. In the afternoon, the service was similar
to that of the morning. Every thing was conducted with
much solemnity. After worship, the Indians gathered
in their lodges, and conversed together concerning what
they had heard. If doubt arose as to any point, it was
solved by the instructed Indian. Thus passed the sabbath
among the Skyuse.</p>

<p>On the 29th, I hired Crickie to take me to the Dalles;
and, Mrs. Whitman having filled my sacks with bread,
corn-meal, and other edibles, I lashed my packs once more
for the lower Columbia.</p>

stepson of Dr McLoughlin, the Hudson's Bay factor at Fort Vancouver. It was
at first but a miserable pen of crooked saplings, a few miles up Boise River; but
later was, as Farnham mentions, removed below the mouth of the river, and
constructed of adobe. It was an important station on the Oregon Trail&mdash;the
resting place after the difficult travel of the Snake River plains, and before
attempting the rough route to the Columbia. With the decline of the fur-trade,
the importance of Fort Boise was much diminished, and when it was destroyed
(1853) by a remarkable rise of Snake River, it was but partially repaired. A
neighboring Indian massacre (1854) caused the post to be entirely abandoned the
succeeding year. In 1863 the government built a military post known as Fort
Boise, or Boise Barracks, fifty miles above the old Hudson's Bay post, at the site
of the modern city of Boise.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p></div>

in 1836, and the following passages in Mrs. Whitman's letters (Oregon Pioneer
Association <i>Transactions</i>, 1891, pp. 40-68) relate thereto: "July 25. Husband had
a tedious time with the wagon to-day. It got stuck in the creek this morning
when crossing and he was obliged to wade considerably in getting it out. After
that, in going between the mountains, on the side of one, so steep that it was
difficult for horses to pass, the wagon was upset twice.... 28th. One of the
axle-trees of the wagon broke to-day; was a little rejoiced, for we were in hopes
they would leave it, and have no more trouble with it. Our rejoicing was in vain
for they are making a cart of the back wheels, this afternoon, and lashing the fore
wheels to it&mdash;intending to take it through in some shape or other". On Snake
River the box was abandoned, and finally what remained of the vehicle was left
at Fort Boise. When Joseph L. Meek came through in 1840, he secured the remains
of this historic wagon and transported his family therein to Dr. Whitman's
station at Waiilatpu.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p></div>

thence it was transferred to Lapwai, where it continued in use, printing native

an historical relic. It has found a home in the state house at Salem. See Oregon

of wild wormwood. Encamped on the northern branch of
the Wallawalla River.</p>

<p>{151} October 1. At ten o'clock to-day, I was kindly
received by Mr. Pambrun at Fort Wallawalla.<a name="FNanchor_223" id="FNanchor_223"></a><a href="#Footnote_223" class="fnanchor">[223]</a> This
gentleman is a half-pay officer in the British army. His
rank in the Hudson Bay Company, is that of "clerk in
charge" of this post. He is of French extraction, a native
of Canada. I breakfasted with him and his family.
His wife, a half breed of the country, has a numerous and
beautiful family. The breakfast being over, Mr. Pambrun
invited me to view the premises. The fort is a plank
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[Pg 347]</a></span>stockade, with a number of buildings within, appropriated
to the several uses of a store, blacksmith-shop, dwellings,
&amp;c. It has a bastion in the north-east corner, mounted
with cannon. The country around has sometimes been
represented as fruitful and beautiful. I am obliged to
deny so foul an imputation upon the fair fame of dame
Nature. It is an ugly desert; designed to be such, made
such, and is such.</p>

<p>About seven miles up the Wallawalla River, are two
or three acres of ground fenced with brush, capable of
bearing an inferior species of Yankee pumpkin; and
another spot somewhere, of the fourth of an acre, capable
of producing anything that grows in the richest kind of
unmoistened {152} sand. But aside from these distinguished
exceptions, the vicinity of Fort Wallawalla is a
desert. There is, indeed, some beauty and sublimity in
sight, but no fertility. The wild Columbia sweeps along
under its northern wall. In the east, roll up to heaven
dark lofty ridges of mountains; in the north-west, are
the ruins of extinct and terrible volcanic action; in the
west, a half mile, is the entrance of the river into the vast
chasm of its lower course, abutted on either side by splendidly
castellated rocks, a magnificent gateway for its floods.</p>

<p>But this is all. Desert describes it as well as it does
the wastes of Arabia. I tarried only two hours with the
hospitable Mr. Pambrun. But as if determined that
I should remember that I would have been a welcome
guest a much longer time, he put some tea and sugar and
bread into my packs, and kindly expressed regrets that
our mutual admiration of Napoleon should be thus crowded
into the chit-chat of hours instead of weeks. A fine companionable
fellow; I hope he will command Fort Wallawalla
as long as Britons occupy it, and live a hundred years
afterwards.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[Pg 348]</a></span></p>

<p>Travelled down the south bank of the Columbia along
the water-side; the river half {153} a mile in width, with
a deep strong current; water very clear. A short distance
from this brink, on both sides, rose the embankments of
the chasm it has worn for itself, in the lapse of ages&mdash;a
noble gorge, worthy of its mighty waters. The northern
one might properly be termed a mountain running continuously
along the water's edge, seven hundred or eight
hundred feet in height, black, shining, and shrubless.
The southern one consisted of earthy bluffs, alternating
with cliffs from one hundred to four hundred feet above
the stream, turreted with basaltic shafts, some twenty,
others one hundred feet above the subjacent hills.</p>

<p>Passed a few horses travelling industriously from one
wisp of dry bunch grass to another. Every thing unnatural,
dry, brown, and desolate. Climbed the heights near sunset,
and had an extensive view of the country south of the
river. It was a treeless, brown expanse of dearth, vast
rolling swells of sand and clay, too dry to bear wormwood.
No mountains seen in that direction. On the north they
rose precipitously from the river, and hid from view the
country beyond. The Wallawalla Indians brought us
drift-wood and fresh salmon, for which they desired
"shmoke," tobacco.</p>

<p>{154} 2nd. Continued to descend the river. Early
in the day, basalt disappeared from the bluffs; and the
country north and south opened to view five or six miles
from the stream. It was partially covered with dry bunch
grass; groups of Indian horses occasionally appeared.
But I was impressed with the belief that the journeyings
from one quid of grass to another, and from these to
water, were sufficient to enfeeble the constitution of the
best horse in Christendom. The wild wormwood, of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[Pg 349]</a></span>
"blessed memory," greeted my eyes and nose, wherever
its scrags could find sand to nourish them.</p>

<p>During the day I was gratified with the sight of five or
six trees, and these a large species of willow, themselves
small and bowed with age; stones and rocks more or less
fused. A strong westerly wind buffeted me; and much of
the time filled the air with drifting sand. We encamped
at the water side about three o'clock. I had thus a fine
opportunity of ascending the heights to view the southern
plain. The slopes were well covered with grass, and
seemed easy of ascent; but on trial proved extremely laborious.
I however climbed slowly and patiently the long
sweeps for two hours, and gained nothing. Nay, I could
see the noble {155} river, like a long line of liquid fire
blazing with the light of the western sun; and the rush
wigwams of the Wallawallas, dotting the sands of the
opposite shore; and the barren bluffs and rocks beyond
them piled away into space. But to the south my vision
was hemmed in by the constantly rising swells. No
extensive view could be obtained from any of the heights.</p>

<p>The sun was fast sinking, and the hills rose as I advanced.
I was so weary that I could go little further. But taking
a careful view of the peaks which would guide me back to
my camp, I determined to travel on till it should become too
dark to see what might open before me. I climbed slowly
and tediously the seemingly endless swells, lifting themselves
over and beyond each other in beautiful, but to my wearied
limbs, and longing eyes in most vexatious continuity, till
the sun dipped his lower rim beneath the horizon.</p>

<p>A volcano burst the hills, thought I; and on I trudged
with the little strength that a large quantity of vexation
gave me. Fires blister your beautiful brows, I half uttered,
as I dragged myself up the crowning eminence, and saw<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[Pg 350]</a></span>
the plateau declining in irregular undulations far into
the south-west&mdash;{156} a sterile waste, clothed in the
glories of the last rays of a splendid sunset. The crests
of the distant swells were fringed with bunch grass; not
a shrub or a tree on all the field of vision; and evidently
no water nearer than the Columbia. Those cattle which
are, in the opinions of certain travellers, to depasture these
plains in future time, must be of sound wind and limb to
gather food and water the same day. I found myself so
wearied on attaining this goal of my wishes, that, notwithstanding
the lateness of the hour, I was literally compelled
to seek some rest before attempting to descend.</p>

<p>I therefore seated myself, and in the luxury of repose
permitted darkness to commence creeping over the landscape,
before I could rouse myself to the effort of moving.
When I did start, my style of locomotion was extremely
varied, and withal sometimes not the most pleasant to every
portion of the mortal coil. My feet were not unfrequently
twice or thrice the length of that measure in advance of
my body. But the reader must not suppose that this circumstance
diminished my speed. I continued to slide
down the hills, using as vehicles the small sharp stones
beneath me, until an opportunity offered to put my {157}
nether extremities under me again. Once I had nearly
plunged headlong from a precipice some fifty feet high,
and saved myself by catching a wormwood bush standing
within three feet of the brink. Finally, without any serious
mishap, I arrived in camp, so completely exhausted, that,
without tasting food, I threw myself on my couch for the
night.</p>

<p>3rd. The earthy bluffs continued to bind the chasm
of the river till mid-day, when buttresses of basalt took
their place. A little bunch grass grew among the wild
wormwood. Turkeys, grouse, and a species of large<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[Pg 351]</a></span>
hare frequently appeared; many ducks in the stream. For
three hours before sunset the trail was rugged and precipitous,
often overhanging the river, and so narrow that
a mis-step of four inches would have plunged horse and
rider hundreds of feet into the boiling flood. But as Skyuse
horses never make such disagreeable mistakes, we rode
the steeps in safety. Encamped in a small grove of willows.
The river along the day's march was hemmed in by lofty
and rugged mountains. The rocks showed indubitable
evidences of a volcanic origin. As the sun went down,
the Wallawalla village on the opposite shore {158} sang
a hymn in their own language, to a tune which I have
often heard sung in Catholic Churches, before the image
of the Virgin. The country in the south, as seen from
the heights, was broken and barren; view limited in all
directions by the unevenness of the surface.</p>

<p>4th. Awakened this morning by the fall of a hundred
tons of rock from the face of the mountain near us. The
earth trembled as if the slumbering volcanoes were wrestling
in its bowels. We were brought to our feet, and
opened and rubbed our eyes with every mark of despatch.
My "poor crane" and his hopeful son condescended to
appear shocked; an event in an Indian's life that occurs
as seldom as his birth. I had stationed myself near the
fallen rocks as the sun's first rays awoke the morning hymn
of the Indian village.</p>

<p>It was a sweet wild tune that they sung to God among
the dark mountains of the Columbia. And sweeter,
perhaps, in such a place, where every motion of the heart
is a monition that one is alone, and every thought brings
with it the remembrance that the social affections are
separated from the objects of their fondness, and where
every moral sensibility is chilled by a sense of {159} desolation
and danger, calling into exercise the resisting and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[Pg 352]</a></span>
exterminating propensities, and where the holy memories
of home find no response but in some loved star in the
unchanging heavens. In such a place how far sweeter
than anything beside is the evidence of the religious principle&mdash;the
first teaching of a mother's love, rising over
the wastes of nature from the altar of a pure heart&mdash;the
incense of love going up to the heavenly presence.</p>

<p>At eight o'clock we were en route; at nine o'clock approached
the bend in the river, where it changes from
a south-west to a north-west course.<a name="FNanchor_224" id="FNanchor_224"></a><a href="#Footnote_224" class="fnanchor">[224]</a> At this place
the cliffs which overhang the southern bank presented a
fine collection of basaltic columns. Along the margin of
the river lay hillocks of scori&aelig;, piled together in every
imaginable form of confusion. Among them grew considerable
quantities of bunch grass, on which a band of
Wallawalla horses were feeding. Sand-hills on the
opposite shore rose one thousand feet in the air. Basalt
occurred at intervals, in a more or less perfect state of
formation, till the hour of noon, when the trail led to the
base of a series of columns extending three-fourths of a
mile down the bank. These were more perfectly formed
than any previously seen.</p>

<p>{160} They swelled from a large curve of the mountain
side, like the bastions of ancient castles; and one series
of lofty columns towered above another, till the last was
surmounted by a crowning tower, a little above the level
of the plain beyond. And their pentagonal form, longitudinal
sections, dark shining fracture, and immense masses
strewn along my way, betokened me if not in the very presence
of the Giant's Causeway, yet on a spot where the
same mighty energies had exerted themselves which built<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[Pg 353]</a></span>
that rare, beautiful wonder of the Emerald Isle. The
river was very tortuous, and shut in by high dykes of
basalt and sand hills the remainder of the day; saw three
small rapids in the Columbia; encamped at sunset; too
weary to climb the heights.</p>

<p>5th. Arose at break of day, and ordering my guide
to make arrangements for starting as soon as I should
return, I ascended the neighbouring heights. Grassy
undulating plains in all directions south of the river.
Far in the north-east towered the frozen peak of Mount
Washington, a perfect pyramid, clothed with eternal
snows.<a name="FNanchor_225" id="FNanchor_225"></a><a href="#Footnote_225" class="fnanchor">[225]</a> The view in the north was hemmed in by
mountains which rose higher than the place of observation.
On descending, my guide Crickie complained of
ill-health; and assigned that {161} circumstance as a
reason why he should not proceed with me to the Dalles.
I was much vexed with him at the time, for his unseasonable
desertion, and believed that the real inducement to
his course was the danger to be apprehended from the
Indians at the Shutes. But I was sorry to learn from
Dr. Whitman afterwards that the poor fellow was actually
sick, and that he suffered much at the sand bank encampment,
where I left him. After paying Crickie for his
faithful services thus far along, and giving him four days'
provision for himself and boy, a Wallawalla Indian who
had encamped with us the previous night, took charge
of Crickie's horses, bearing myself and packs, and led
the way down the river.</p>

<p>The "poor crane" was an honest, honourable man;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[Pg 354]</a></span>
and I can never think of all his kind acts to me, from
the time I met him in the plains beyond the Wallawalla
mission, till I left him sick on the bank of the Columbia,
without wishing an opportunity to testify my sense of
his moral worth and goodness of heart in some way which
shall yield him a substantial reward for all he suffered
in my service. Two hours' ride brought to my ears the
music of the "tum tum orter;" {162} the Indian-English
for the "thundering waters" of the Shutes.<a name="FNanchor_226" id="FNanchor_226"></a><a href="#Footnote_226" class="fnanchor">[226]</a> These
are the only perpendicular falls of the Columbia, in its
course from the junction of its great northern and southern
branches, to the ocean. And they do indeed thunder.
A stratum of black rock forming the bed of the river above,
by preserving its horizontal position, rises at this place
above the natural surface of the stream, and forms an
abrupt precipice, hanging sixty feet in height over the
bed below.</p>

<p>The river, when I passed was unfortunately at its lower
stage&mdash;still the Shutes were terribly grand. The main
body of the water swept around near its southern bank,
and being there compressed into, a narrow rough channel,
chafed its angry way to the brink, where, bending a massive
curve, as if hesitating to risk the leap, it plunged into a
narrow cavern sixty feet deep, with a force and volume
which made the earth tremble. The noise was prodigious,
deafening, and echoed in awful tumult among the barren
mountains. Further towards the other shore, smaller
jets were rushing from the imprisoned rocks which clustered
near the brow of the cliff, into other caverns; {163} and
close under the north bank, and farther down the stream,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[Pg 355]</a></span>
thundered another, nearly equal in grandeur to the one
first described.</p>

<p>On the portions of the rocky stratum left by the chafing
waters, in wearing out numerous channels below the
present situation of the Shutes, were the flag huts of
one hundred Wallawalla fishermen. They were taking
salmon with scoop nets and bone pointed spears. These
people are filthy and naked. Some sat by fires swallowing
roasted salmon; others greasing themselves with the
oil of that fish; others were dressing and drying them;
others stood down on the projections in the chasms,
sweeping their nets in the foaming waters; untaught,
un-elevated, least intelligent, least improvable human
nature! It was not deemed safe to remain long among
these savages, who had begun to examine my packs with
more interest than strictly honest intentions towards
them seemed to require, and I took to the trail again on
a fast trot.</p>

<p>Some of them endeavoured to follow on foot, demanding
a tribute of "smoke" for the privilege of passing their
dominions. But having none at hand I pushed on, without
regarding their suit, over sand hills, {164} beds of
volcanic stones, and hanging declivities, till rounding
a basaltic buttress, I came in view of the little plain on
the south western shore of the Dalles. The "Dalles,"
a French term for "flat stones," is applied to a portion
of the river here, where, by a process similar to that going
on at Niagara, the waters have cut channels through an
immense stratum of black rock, over which they used to
fall as at the Shutes.<a name="FNanchor_227" id="FNanchor_227"></a><a href="#Footnote_227" class="fnanchor">[227]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[Pg 356]</a></span></p>

<p>At low stages these are of sufficient capacity to pass
all the waters. But the annual floods overflow the "flat
stones," and produce a lashing and leaping, and whirling
of waters, too grand for the imagination to conceive.
These "Dalles" are covered with the huts of the Chinooks,
a small band of a tribe of the same name, which inhabits
the banks of Columbia from this place to its mouth.<a name="FNanchor_228" id="FNanchor_228"></a><a href="#Footnote_228" class="fnanchor">[228]</a>
They flatten their heads and perforate the septum of the
nose, as do the Wallawallas, Skyuse and Nez Perc&eacute;s.</p>

<p>The depression of the southern embankment of the
chasm of the river at the Dalles, extends eight miles along
the stream, and from a half mile to a mile in width. It
is broken by ledges bursting through the {165} surface,
and in parts loaded with immense boulders of detached
rocks. Along the north-western border are groves of
small white oaks; and on the highlands in that direction
are forests of pine, spruce and other evergreens, clothing
the whole country westward to the snowy peaks of the
President's Range.</p>

<p>In the south-west, specked with clusters of bunch grass,
is an open rolling plain, which stretches beyond the reach
of vision. In the north rise sharp mountains, thinly clad
with evergreen trees; through an opening among the
peaks of which, appeared the shining apex of Mount
Adams.<a name="FNanchor_229" id="FNanchor_229"></a><a href="#Footnote_229" class="fnanchor">[229]</a> In the north-east sweep away in brown barrenness,
naked cliffs and sandy wastes. I had taken a bird's-eye
view of the Dalles and the region round about, when
my Indian cried out "Lee house." And there it was,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[Pg 357]</a></span>a mission house of the American P. E. Methodist Church,
in charge of Messrs. Lee and Perkins.<a name="FNanchor_230" id="FNanchor_230"></a><a href="#Footnote_230" class="fnanchor">[230]</a></p>

<p>I spent a week at the Dalles' mission, eating salmon
and growing fat; an event that had not lately occurred
in the republic of the members of my mortal confederacy.</p>

<p>The buildings of the mission, are a dwelling-house,
{166} a house for worship and for school purposes, and
a workshop, &amp;c. The first is a log structure thirty by
twenty feet, one and a half floor high, shingle roofs, and
floors made of plank cut with a whip-saw from the pines
of the hills. The lower story is divided into two rooms&mdash;the
one a dining-room, the other the family apartment
of Mr. Perkins and lady. These are lined overhead
and at the sides with beautiful rush mats manufactured
by the Indians. The upper story is partitioned into six
dormitories, and a school-room for Indian children; all
neatly lined with mats. Underneath is an excellent cellar.
The building designed for a house of worship, was being
built when I arrived. Its architecture is a curiosity.</p>

<p>The frame is made in the usual form, save that instead
of four main posts at the corners, and others at considerable
distances, for the support of lateral girders, there
were eleven on each side, and six on each end, beside
the corner posts&mdash;all equal in size and length. Between
these billets of wood were driven transversely, on which
as lathing, mortar made of clay, sand and straw, were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[Pg 358]</a></span>
laid to a level with their exterior and interior faces. There
is so little falling {167} weather here, that this mode of
building was considered sufficiently substantial.</p>

<p>Messrs. Lee and Perkins were formerly connected
with the mission on the Willamette. Eighteen months
before I had the happiness of enjoying their hospitality,
they came to this spot with axes on their shoulders, felled
trees, ploughed, fenced, and planted twenty acres of land
with their own hands, and erected these habitations of
civilization and Christianity on the bosom of the howling
wilderness. Their premises are situated on elevated
ground, about a mile south-west from the river. Immediately
back is a grove of small white oaks and yellow pines;
a little north, is a sweet spring bursting from a ledge of
rocks which supplies water for house use, and moistens
about an acre of rich soil. About a mile to the south,
are two or three hundred acres of fine land, with groves
of oaks around, and an abundant supply of excellent
water. Here it was the intention of the mission to open
a farm under the care of a layman from the States.</p>

<p>A mile and a half to the north, is a tract of about two
hundred acres, susceptible of being plentifully irrigated
by a number of large streams that pour down upon it
from {168} the western mountains. Here, too, they
intended to locate laymen to open farms, and extract
from the idle earth the means of feeding themselves, the
Indians, and the wayworn white man from the burnt
solitudes of the mountains. No location, not even the
sacred precincts of St. Bernard, on the snows of the Alps,
could be better chosen for the operations of a holy benevolence.</p>

<p>The Indians from many quarters flock to the Dalles
and the Shutes in the spring, and autumn, and winter
to purchase salmon; the commercial movements between<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[Pg 359]</a></span>
the States and the Pacific will pass their door; and there
in after-days, the sturdy emigrants from the States will
stop, (as did the pilgrims on Plymouth rock,) to give
grateful praise to Him who stood forth in their aid, not
indeed while struggling on the foamy billow, but on the
burning plain and the icy cliff, and in the deadly turmoil
of Indian battles on the way, and will seek food and rest
for their emaciated frames, before entering the woody
glen and flowing everglades of Lower Oregon.</p>

<p>A saw-mill, a grist-mill, and other machinery necessary
to carry out a liberal plan of operations, are in contemplation.
The {169} fruit of the oak, it is supposed,
will support 1,000 hogs from the middle of August to
the middle of April; the products of the arable soil will
suffice to make that number into marketable pork; and
as the grass and other vegetation grow there during the
winter months, twenty-five or thirty square miles of
pasturage round about, will enable them to raise, at a
trifling expense, immense numbers of sheep, horses and
cattle. Five acres of ground cultivated in 1839, produced
twenty-five bushels of the small grains, seventy-five bushels
of potatoes, and considerable quantities of other vegetables.
This was an experiment only on soil not irrigated. Gentlemen
suppose it capable of producing double that amount,
if irrigated. The season, too, was unusually dry.</p>

<p>Around about the mission are clusters of friable sand-stone
rocks of remarkable form. Their height varies
from ten to thirty feet; their basilar diameters from three
to ten feet: their shape generally resembles that of the
obelisk. These (fifteen or twenty in number) standing
among the oaks and pines, often in clusters, and sometimes
solitary, give a strange interest of antiquity to the
spot. And this illusion is increased by a {170} rock of
another form, an immense boulder resting upon a short,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[Pg 360]</a></span>
slender pedestal, and strikingly resembling the Egyptian
sphynx. The Indian tradition in regard to them is, that
they were formerly men, who, for some sin against the
Great Spirit, were changed to stone.</p>

<p>At the Dalles is the upper village of the Chinooks. At
the Shutes, five miles above, is the lower village of the
Wallawallas. One of the missionaries, Mr. Lee, learns
the Chinook language, and the other, Mr. Perkins, the
Wallawalla; and their custom is to repair on Sabbath
days each to his own people, and teach them the Christian
religion. The Chinooks flatten their heads more, and
are more stupid than any other tribe on the Columbia.
There was one among the Dalles' band, who, it was said,
resisted so obstinately the kind efforts of his parents to
crush his skull into the aristocratic shape, that they abandoned
him to the care of nature in this regard; and much
to the scandal of his family, his head grew in the natural
form. I saw him every day while I staid there. He
was evidently the most intelligent one of the band. His
name is Boston; so called, because the form of his head
resembles that of Americans, {171} whom the Indians
call "Boston," in order to distinguish them from "King
George's men,"&mdash;the Hudson Bay Company gentlemen.
Boston, although of mean origin, has, on account of his
superior energy and intelligence, become the war chief
of the Dalles.</p>

<p>On the morning of the 14th, I overhauled my baggage,
preparatory to descending the river. In doing so, I was
much vexed to find that the Indians had, in some manner,
drawn my saddle to the window of the workshop in which
it was deposited, and stripped it of stirrups, stirrup-straps,
surcingle, girths, and crupper. They had also stolen my
bridle.</p>

<p>The loss of these articles, in a region where they could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[Pg 361]</a></span>
not be purchased&mdash;articles so necessary to me in carrying
out my designs of travelling over the lower country,
roused in me the bitterest determination to regain them
at all hazards. Without reflecting for a moment upon
the disparity of numbers between my single self and forty
or fifty able-bodied Indians, I armed myself completely,
and marched my solitary battalion to the camp of the
principal chief, and entered it. He was away. I explained
to some persons there by signs {172} and a few words,
the object of my search, and marched my army to an
elevated position and halted.</p>

<p>I had been stationed but a short time, when the Indians
began to collect in their chief's lodge, and whisper
earnestly. Ten minutes passed thus, and Indians were
constantly arriving and entering. I was supported in the
rear by a lusty oak, and so far as I remember, was ready
to exclaim with the renowned antagonist of Roderick Dhu,</p>

<p class="center">"Come one, come all;" &amp;c.
</p>

<p>but never having been a hero before or since, I am not
quite certain that I thought any such thing. My wrath,
however, was extreme. To be robbed for the first time by
Indians, and that by such cowardly wretches as these
Chinooks were; and robbed too of my means of exploring
Oregon, when on the very threshold of the most
charming part of it, was an inconvenience and an
ignominy worth a battle to remove.</p>

<p>Just at the moment of this lofty conclusion, thirty-eight
or forty Indians rushed around me; eight or ten
loaded muskets were levelled at my chest, within ten
feet of me, and the old chief stood within five feet, with
{173} a duelling pistol loaded, cocked, and pointed at
my heart. While this movement was being made, I
brought my rifle to bear upon the old chief's vital organs.
Thus both armies stood for the space of five minutes,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[Pg 362]</a></span>
without the movement of tongue or muscle. Then one
of the braves intimated that it was "not good" for me
to be out with arms; and that I must immediately accommodate
myself within doors. But to this proposition
the bravery of my army would not submit. I accordingly
informed him to that effect; whereupon the opposing
army went into a furious rage.</p>

<p>At this juncture of affairs, Mr. Lee came up, and acted
as interpreter. He inquired into the difficulty, and was
told that the "whole Chinook tribe was threatened with
invasion, and all the horrors of a general war, on what
account they knew not." The commander of my army
reported that they had robbed him, and deserved such
treatment; and that he had taken arms to annihilate the
tribe, unless they had restored to him what they had stolen.</p>

<p>I was then told that "it was not good for me to appear
in arms&mdash;that it was good for me to go into the house."
To this, my army with one voice replied, "Nay, never,
{174} never leave the ground, or the Chinooks alive, tribe
or chief, if the stolen property be not restored;" and wheeling
my battalion, drove first one flank and then the other
of the opposing hosts, fifty yards into the depths of the forests.</p>

<p>During this movement, worthy of the best days of
Spartan valour, the old chief stood amazed to see his
followers, with guns loaded and cocked, fly before such
inferior numbers. After effecting the complete rout of
the opposing infantry, the army under my command
took up the old position without the loss of a single man.
But the old chief was still there, as dogged and sullen
as Indian ever was. On approaching him, he presented
his pistol again near my chest, whereupon my rifle was
instantly in a position to reach his; and thus the renowned
leaders of these mighty hosts stood for the space of an
hour without bloodshed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[Pg 363]</a></span></p>

<p>Perhaps such another chief was never seen; such
unblenching coolness&mdash;excepting always the heat which
was thrown off in a healthful and profuse perspiration&mdash;and
such perfect undauntedness, except an unpleasant
knocking of the knees together, produced probably by
the anticipated blasts of December. But while these
exhibitions {175} of valour were being enacted, one stirrup
was thrown at my feet, and then the other, and then
the straps, the crupper, &amp;c., until all the most valuable
articles lost, were piled before me. The conquest was
complete, and will doubtless shed immortal lustre upon
the gallant band, who, in the heart of the wilderness,
dared to assert and maintain, against the encroachments
of a numerous and well-disciplined foe, the "&eacute;lite" of
the Chinook army, the rights and high prerogative of
brave freemen and soldiers. The number of killed and
wounded of the enemy had not been ascertained, when
the troops under my command departed for the lower
country.</p>

<p>In the evening which succeeded this day of carnage, the
old chief assembled his surviving followers, and made war
speeches until midnight. His wrath was immeasurable.
On the following morning, the Indians in the employ of
the mission left their work.</p>

<p>About ten o'clock, one of the tribe appeared with a
pack-horse, to convey Mr. Lee's and my own packs to the
water-side. The old chief also appeared, and bade him
desist. He stood armed before the house an hour, making
many threats against the {176} Bostons, individually
and collectively; but finally retired. As soon as he had
entered his lodge, the horse of his disobedient subject
was loaded, and rushed to the river. An effort was made
to get oarsmen for our canoe, but the old hero of a legion
of devils told them, "the high Bostons would kill them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[Pg 364]</a></span>
all, and that they must not go with him." Mr. Lee,
however, did not despair.</p>

<p>We followed the baggage towards the river. When
within a quarter of a mile of it, two Americans, members
of Richardson's party, Mr. Lee and an Indian or two,
whom the old chief had not succeeded in frightening
took the canoe from the bushes, and bore it to the river
on their shoulders.</p>

<p>The natives were stationed beyond rifle-shot upon
the rocks on either side of the way, bows and arrows,
and guns in hand. Indian Boston was in command.
He stood on the loftiest rock, grinding his teeth, and growling
like a bloodhound, "Bostons ugh;" and springing
upon his bow, drove his arrows into the ground with
demoniac madness. I stopped, and drew my rifle to
my face, whereupon there was a grand retreat behind
the rocks. My army marched slowly and majestically
on, as became the dignity {177} of veteran victors. The
women and children fled from the wigwams by the way;
and the fear of the annihilation of the whole tribe only
abated when my wrath was, to their understanding,
appeased by the interference of Mr. Lee. Thus the tribe
was saved from my vengeance&mdash;the whole number,
fifty or sixty stout savages, were saved! an instance of
clemency, a parallel to which will scarcely be found in
the history of past ages.</p>

<p>Being convinced, at last, that my intentions towards
them had become more pacific, six oarsmen, a bowsman,
and steersman, were readily engaged by Mr. Lee, and
he shoved off from that memorable battle-ground on a
voyage to the Willamette. These Indians have been
notorious thieves ever since they have been known to
the whites. Their meanness has been equally well known.
Destitute of every manly and moral virtue, they and their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[Pg 365]</a></span>
fathers have hung around the Dalles, eaten salmon, and
rotted in idleness and vice; active only in mischief, and
honest only in their crouching cowardice towards those
they suppose able to punish their villany.<a name="FNanchor_231" id="FNanchor_231"></a><a href="#Footnote_231" class="fnanchor">[231]</a></p>

<p>There is some very curious philosophy among them:
as for example, they believe {178} human existence to
be indestructible by the laws of nature; and never diseased,
unless made so by the Medicine men or conjurers, who
are believed to enter into the system in an unseen manner,
and pull at the vitals. They also hold that one Medicine
man can cast out another. Accordingly, when one of
them is called to a patient and does not succeed in restoring
him to health, he is believed to be accessory to his
death, and is punished as such by the relatives of the
deceased.</p>

<p>Their mode of treating patients is to thrust them into
a sweat oven, and thence, reeking with perspiration, into
the cold streams. After this, they are stretched out at
length on the ground, wrapped very warmly, and kneaded,
and rolled, and rubbed, with great severity. The abdomen
is violently pressed down to the spine, and the forehead
pressed with the might of the operator; the arms and
limbs, pinched and rubbed, rolled and bruised. Meanwhile,
the conjuror is uttering most beastly noises. As
might be supposed, patients labouring under the febrile
diseases, are soon destroyed.</p>

<p>In order, however, to keep up their influence among
the people, the conjurors of {179} a tribe, male and female,
have cabalistic dances. After the darkness of night sets<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[Pg 366]</a></span>
in, they gather together in a wigwam, build a large fire
in the centre, spread the floor with elk skins, set up on end
a wide cedar board, and suspend near it a stick of wood
in a horizontal position. An individual seizes the end
of the stick, swings the other end against the cedar board,
and thus beats noisy time to a still more noisy chant.
The dance is commenced sometimes by a man alone, and
often by a man and woman. And various and strange
are the bodily contortions of the performers. They jump
up and down, and swing their arms with more and more
violence, as the noise of the singing and thumping accompaniment
increases, and yelp, and froth at the mouth,
till the musician winds up with the word "<i>ugh</i>"&mdash;a long,
strong, gutteral grunt; or until some one of the dancers
falls apparently dead.</p>

<p>When the latter is the case, one of the number walks
around the prostrate individual, and calls his or her name
loudly at each ear, at the nose, fingers, and toes. After
this ceremony, the supposed dead shudders greatly, and
comes to life. And thus they continue to sing, and thump,
and {180} dance, and die, and come to life through the
night. They are said to be very expert at sleight of hand.</p>

<p>The Chinooks, like all other Indians, believe in existence
after death; but their views of the conditions of that existence,
I could not learn. The conjurors teach them, that
they themselves shall be able to visit their tribe after the
body shall have decayed; and when approaching the end
of their days, inform the people in what shape they will
manifest themselves. Some choose a horse, others a
deer, others an elk, &amp;c., and when they die, the image
of their transmigrated state is erected over their remains.<a name="FNanchor_232" id="FNanchor_232"></a><a href="#Footnote_232" class="fnanchor">[232]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[Pg 367]</a></span></p>

<p>The reader is desired to consider Mr. Lee and myself
gliding, arrow-like, down the deep clear Columbia, at two
o'clock in the afternoon of the 15th, and to interest himself
in the bold mountain embankments clothed with the
deep, living green of lofty pine and fir forests, while I revert
to the kind hospitalities of the Dalles' mission. Yet how
entirely impossible is it to relate all that one enjoys in
every muscle of the body, every nerve and sense, and every
affection of the spirit when he flies from the hardships
and loneliness of deserts to the {181} comforts of a bed,
a chair, and a table, and the holy sympathy of hearts
moulded and controlled by the higher sentiments. I had
taken leave of Mr. and Mrs. Perkins with the feelings
that one experiences in civilized lands, when leaving long-tried
and congenial friends.</p>

<p>The good man urged me to return and explore with
him, during the rainy season in the lower country, some
extensive and beautiful prairies, which the Indians say
lie sixty or seventy miles in the north, on the east side
of the President's range; and Mrs. Perkins kindly proposed
to welcome my return for that object with a splendid suit
of buckskin, to be used in my journeyings.</p>

<p>But I must leave my friends to introduce the reader
to the "Island of the Tombs."<a name="FNanchor_233" id="FNanchor_233"></a><a href="#Footnote_233" class="fnanchor">[233]</a> Mr. Lee pointed to it,
as the tops of the cedar board houses of the dead peered
over the hillocks of sand and rock among which they
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[Pg 368]</a></span>stood. We moored our canoe on the western side, and
climbed up a precipice of black shining rocks two hundred
feet; and winding among drifts of sand the distance of
one hundred yards came to the tombs. They consisted
of boxes ten or twelve feet square on the ground, eight or
ten high, made of cedar {182} boards fastened to a rough
frame, in an upright position at the sides, and horizontally
over the top. On them, and about them, were the cooking
utensils, and other personal property of the deceased.
Within were the dead bodies, wrapped in many thicknesses
of deer and elk skins, tightly lashed with leather
thongs, and laid in a pile with their heads to the east.
Underneath the undecayed bodies were many bones from
which the flesh and wrappings had fallen: in some instances
a number of waggon loads. Three or four of the tombs
had gone to ruins, and the skulls and other bones lay
strewn on the ground. The skulls were all flattened.
I picked up one with the intention of bringing it to the
States. But as Mr. Lee assured me that the high veneration
of the living for the dead would make the attempt
very dangerous, I reluctantly returned it to its resting
place.<a name="FNanchor_234" id="FNanchor_234"></a><a href="#Footnote_234" class="fnanchor">[234]</a></p>

<p>We glided merrily down the river till sunset, and landed
on the northern shore to sup. The river had varied from
one to one and a half miles in width, with rather a sluggish
current; water clear, cool, and very deep. Various
kinds of duck, divers, &amp;c., were upon its beautiful surface.
The {183} hair seal was abundant.<a name="FNanchor_235" id="FNanchor_235"></a><a href="#Footnote_235" class="fnanchor">[235]</a> The mountains rose
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[Pg 369]</a></span>abruptly on either side from five hundred to two thousand
feet, in sweeping heights, clad with evergreen trees.
Some few small oaks grew in the nooks by the water
side. Among these were Indian wigwams, constructed
of boards split from the red cedar on the mountains.
I entered some of them. They were filthy in the extreme.
In one of them was a sick man. A withered old female
was kneading and pinching the devil out of him. He
was labouring under a bilious fever. But as a "Medicine
man" was pulling at his gall, it was necessary to expel him;
and the old hag pressed his head, bruised his abdomen,
&amp;c., with the fury and groaning of a bedlamite.</p>

<p>Not an acre of arable land appeared along the shores.
The Indians subsist on fish and acorns of the white oak.
The former they eat fresh during the summer; but their
winter stores they dry and preserve in the following manner:&mdash;The
spine of the fish being taken out, and the flesh being
slashed into checks with a knife, so as to expose as much
surface as possible, is laid on the rocks to dry. After
becoming thoroughly {184} hard, it is bruised to powder,
mixed with the oil of the leaf fat of the fish, and packed
away in flag sacks. Although no salt is used in this preparation,
it remains good till May of the following year.
The acorns, as soon as they fall from the trees, are buried
in sand constantly saturated with water, where they remain
till spring. By this soaking their bitter flavour is said to be
destroyed.</p>

<p>After supper, Mr. Lee ordered a launch, and the Indian
paddles were again dipping in the bright waters. The
stars were out on the clear night, twinkling as of old,
when the lofty peaks around were heaved from the depths
of the volcano. They now looked down on a less grand,
indeed, but more lovely scene. The fires of the natives
blazed among the woody glens, the light canoe skimmed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[Pg 370]</a></span>
the water near the shore, the winds groaned over the
mountain tops, the cascades sang from cliff to cliff, the
loon shouted and dove beneath the shining wave; it was
a wild, almost unearthly scene, in the deep gorge of the
Columbia. The rising of the moon changed its features.
The profoundest silence reigned, save the dash of paddles
that echoed faintly from the shores; our canoe sprang
lightly over {185} the rippling waters, the Indian fires
smouldered among the waving pines; the stars became
dim, and the depths of the blue sky glowed one vast nebula
of mellow light. But the eastern mountains hid awhile
the orb from sight.</p>

<p>The south-western heights shone with its pale beams,
and cast into the deeply sunken river a bewitching dancing
of light and shade, unequalled by the pencil of the wildest
imagination. The grandeur, too, of grove, and cliff,
and mountain, and the mighty Columbia wrapped in the
drapery of a golden midnight! It was the new and rapidly
opening panorama of the sublime wilderness. The scene
changed again when the moon was high in heaven.</p>

<p>The cocks crew in the Indian villages; the birds twittered
on the boughs; the wild fowl screamed, as her light gilded
the chasm of the river, and revealed the high rock Islands
with their rugged crags and mouldering tombs. The
winds from Mount Adams were loaded with frosts, and
the poetry of the night was fast waning into an ague, when
Mr. Lee ordered the steersman to moor. A crackling
pine fire was soon blazing, and having warmed our shivering
{186} frames, we spread our blankets, and slept
sweetly till the dawn.</p>

<p>Early on the morning of the 16th, our Indians were
pulling at the paddles. The sky was overcast, and a
dash of rain occasionally fell, the first I had witnessed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">[Pg 371]</a></span>
since leaving Boyou Salade.<a name="FNanchor_236" id="FNanchor_236"></a><a href="#Footnote_236" class="fnanchor">[236]</a> And although the air
was chilly, and the heavens gloomy, yet when the large
clear drops pattered on my hat, and fell in glad confusion
around our little bark, a thrill of pleasure shot through
my heart. Dangers, wastes, thirst, starvation, eternal
dearth on the earth, and dewless heavens, were matters
only of painful recollection. The present was the reality
of the past engrafted on the hopes of the future; the showery
skies, the lofty green mountains, the tumbling cataracts,
the mighty forests, the sweet savour of teeming groves,
among the like of which I had breathed in infancy, hung
over the threshold of the lower Columbia, the goal of my
wayfaring.</p>

<p>Hearken to that roar of waters! see the hastening of
the flood! hear the sharp rippling by yonder rock; the
whole river sinks from view in advance of us. The bowsman
dips his paddle deeply and quickly; the frail canoe
shoots to the {187} northern shore between a string of
islands and the main land; glides quickly down a narrow
channel; passes a village of cedar board wigwams on a
beautiful little plain to the right; it rounds the lower island;
behold the Cascades!&mdash;an immense trough of boulders
of rocks, down which rushes the "Great River of the
West." The baggage is ashore; the Indians are conveying
the canoe over the portage, and while this is being
done, the reader will have time to explore the lower falls
of the Columbia, and their vicinage.<a name="FNanchor_237" id="FNanchor_237"></a><a href="#Footnote_237" class="fnanchor">[237]</a></p>

<p>The trail of the Portage runs near the torrent, along
the rocky slope on its northern bank, and terminates
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[Pg 372]</a></span>among large loose rocks, blanched by the floods of ages,
at the foot of the trough of the main rapid. It is about
a mile and a half long. At its lower end voyagers reembark
when the river is at a low stage, and run the lower
rapids. But when it is swollen by the annual freshets,
they bear their boats a mile and a half farther down, where
the water is deep and less tumultuous. In walking down
this path, I had a near view of the whole length of the main
rapids. As I have intimated, the bed of the river here
is a vast inclined trough of white rocks, sixty {188} or
eighty feet deep, about four hundred yards wide at the
top, and diminishing to about half that width at the
bottom. The length of this trough is about a mile. In
that distance the water falls about one hundred and thirty
feet; in the rapids, above and below it, about twenty feet,
making the whole descent about one hundred and fifty
feet. The quantity of water which passes here is incalculable.
But an approximate idea of it may be obtained
from the fact that while the velocity is so great, that the
eye with difficulty follows objects floating on the surface,
yet such is its volume at the lowest stage of the river, that
it rises and bends like a sea of molten glass over a channel
of immense rocks, without breaking its surface, except
near the shores, so deep and vast is the mighty flood!</p>

<p>In the June freshets, when the melted snows from the
western declivities of seven hundred miles of the Rocky
Mountains, and those on the eastern sides of the President's
Range, come down, the Cascades must present a
spectacle of sublimity equalled only by Niagara. This
is the passage of the river through the President's Range,
and the mountains near it on either {189} side are worthy
of their distinguished name. At a short distance from
the southern shore they rise in long ridgy slopes, covered
with pines, and other terebinthine trees of extraordinary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[Pg 373]</a></span>
size,<a name="FNanchor_238" id="FNanchor_238"></a><a href="#Footnote_238" class="fnanchor">[238]</a> over the tops of which rise bold black crags, which,
elevating themselves in great grandeur one beyond another,
twenty or thirty miles to the southward, cluster around
the icy base of Mount Washington. On the other side
of the Cascades is a similar scene. Immense and gloomy
forests, tangled with fallen timber and impenetrable underbrush,
cover mountains, which in the States, would excite
the profoundest admiration for their majesty and beauty,
but which dwindle into insignificance as they are viewed
in presence of the shining glaciers, and massive grandeur
of Mount Adams, hanging over them.</p>

<p>The river above the Cascades runs north-westwardly;
but approaching the descent, it turns westward, and,
after entering the trough, south-westwardly, and having
passed this, it resumes its course to the north west. By
this bend, it leaves between its shore and the northern
mountains, a somewhat broken plain, a mile in width,
and about four miles in length. At the upper end of the
rapids, this plain is {190} nearly on a level with the river,
so that an inconsiderable freshet sets the water up a natural
channel half way across the bend. This circumstance,
and the absence of any serious obstruction in the form
of hills, &amp;c., led me to suppose that a canal might be
cut around the Cascades at a trifling expence, which would
not only open steamboat navigation to the Dalles, but
furnish at this interesting spot, an incalculable amount
of water power.<a name="FNanchor_239" id="FNanchor_239"></a><a href="#Footnote_239" class="fnanchor">[239]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[Pg 374]</a></span></p>

<p>The canoe had been deposited among the rocks at the
lower end of the trough, our cocoa and boiled salmon,
bread, butter, potatoes, &amp;c., had been located in their
proper depositories, and we were taking a parting gaze
at the rushing flood, when the sound of footsteps, and
an order given in French to deposit a bale of goods at
the water side, drew our attention to a hearty old gentleman
of fifty or fifty-five, whom Mr. Lee immediately
recognized as Dr. McLaughlin.<a name="FNanchor_240" id="FNanchor_240"></a><a href="#Footnote_240" class="fnanchor">[240]</a> He was about five
feet eleven inches in height, and stoutly built, weighing
about two hundred pounds, with large green blueish eyes,
a ruddy complexion, and hair of snowy whiteness. He
was on his return from London with dispatches from
the Hudson's Bay Company's Board in {191} England,
and with letters from friends at home to the hundreds
of Britons in its employ in the north-western wilderness.
He was in high spirits. Every crag in sight was familiar
to him, had witnessed the energy and zeal of thirty years'
successful enterprise; had seen him in the strength of
ripened manhood, and now beheld his undiminished
energies crowned with the frosted locks of age. We spent
ten minutes with the doctor, and received a kind invitation
to the hospitalities of his post; gave our canoe,
freighted with our baggage, in charge of the Indians, to
take down the lower rapids, and ascended the bluff to the
trail which leads to the tide-water below them. We
climbed two hundred feet among small spruce, pine, fir,
and hemlock trees, to the table land.</p>

<p>The track was strewn with fragments of petrified trees,
from three inches to two feet in diameter, and rocks,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">[Pg 375]</a></span>
(quartz and granite, <i>ex loco</i>), mingled with others more
or less fused. Soon after striking the path on the plain,
we came to a beautiful little lake, lying near the brink
of the hill. It was clear and deep; and around its western,
northern, and eastern shores, drooped the boughs of a
thick hedge of small evergreen {192} trees, which dipped
and rose charmingly in its waters. All around stood
the lofty pines, sighing and groaning in the wind. Nothing
could be seen, but the little lake and the girding forest;
a gem of perfect beauty, reflecting the deep shades of the
unbroken wilderness. A little stream creeping away from
it down the bluff, babbled back the roar of the Cascades.<a name="FNanchor_241" id="FNanchor_241"></a><a href="#Footnote_241" class="fnanchor">[241]</a></p>

<p>The trail led us among deep ravines, clad with heavy
frosts, the soil of which was a coarse gravel, thinly covered
with a vegetable mould. A mile from the lake, we came
upon a plain level again. In this place was a collection
of Indian tombs, similar to those upon the "Island of
tombs." These were six or eight in number, and contained
a great quantity of bones. On the boards around
the sides were painted the figures of death, horses, dogs,
&amp;c. The great destroyer bears the same grim aspect to
the savage mind that he does to ours.&mdash;A skull and the
fleshless bones of a skeleton piled around, were his symbol
upon these rude resting places of the departed.<a name="FNanchor_242" id="FNanchor_242"></a><a href="#Footnote_242" class="fnanchor">[242]</a> One
of them, which our Indian said, contained the remains
of a celebrated "Medicine man," bore the figure of a
horse rudely carved {193} from the red cedar tree. This
was the form in which his <i>posthumous</i> visits were to be
made to his tribe. Small brass kettles, wooden pails,
and baskets of curious workmanship, were piled on the roof.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">[Pg 376]</a></span></p>

<p>Thence onward half a mile over a stony soil, sometimes
open, and again covered with forests, we reached our
canoe by the rocky shore at the foot of the rapids. Mr.
Lee here pointed out to me a strong eddying current on
the southern shore, in which Mr. Cyrus Shepard and
Mrs. Doctor White and child, of the Methodist Mission
on the Willamette, were capsized the year before, in an
attempt to run the lower rapids.<a name="FNanchor_243" id="FNanchor_243"></a><a href="#Footnote_243" class="fnanchor">[243]</a> Mr. Shepard could
not swim&mdash;had sunk the second time, and rose by the
side of the upturned canoe, when he seized the hand of
Mrs. White, who was on the opposite side, and thus sustained
himself and her, until some Indians came to their
relief. On reaching the shore, and turning up the canoe,
the child was found entangled among the cross-bars, dead!</p>

<p>The current was strong where we re-entered our canoe,
and bore us along at a brisk rate.&mdash;The weather, too,
was very agreeable; the sky transparent, and glowing
with a mild October sun. The scenery {194} about us
was truly grand. A few detached wisps of mist clung to
the dark crags of the mountains on the southern shore,
and numerous cascades shot out from the peaks, and
tumbling from one shelf to another, at length plunged
hundreds of feet among confused heaps of rocks in the
vale. The crags themselves were extremely picturesque;
they beetled out so boldly, a thousand feet above the forests
on the sides of the mountain, and appeared to hang so
easily and gracefully on the air. Some of them were
basaltic. One appeared very remarkable. The moun<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">[Pg 377]</a></span>tain
on which it stood was about one thousand two hundred
feet high. On its side there was a deep rocky ravine.
In this, about three hundred feet from the plain, arose a
column of thirty or forty feet in diameter, and, I judged
more than two hundred feet high, surmounted by a cap
resembling the pediment of an ancient church.</p>

<p>Far up its sides grew a number of shrub cedars, which
had taken root in the crevices, and, as they grew, sunk
down horizontally, forming an irregular fringe of green
around it. A short distance further down was seen a
beautiful cascade. The stream appeared to rise near
the very apex of the {195} mountain, and having run a
number of rods in a dark gorge between two peaks, it
suddenly shot from the brink of a cliff into the copse of
evergreen trees at the base of the mountain. The height
of the perpendicular fall appeared to be about six hundred
feet. Some of the water was dispersed in spray before
reaching the ground; but a large quantity of it fell on the
plain, and sent among the heights a noisy and thrilling
echo.<a name="FNanchor_244" id="FNanchor_244"></a><a href="#Footnote_244" class="fnanchor">[244]</a> On the north side of the river, the mountains
were less precipitous, and covered with a dense forest
of pines, cedars, firs, &amp;c.</p>

<p>The bottom lands of the river were alternately prairies
and woodlands; the former clad with a heavy growth
of the wild grasses, dry and brown&mdash;the latter, with
pine, fir, cotton-wood, black ash, and various kinds of
shrubs. The river varied in width from one to two miles,
generally deep and still, but occasionally crossed by sand-bars.
Ten or twelve miles below the cascades we came
upon one, that, stretching two or three miles down the
river, turned the current to the southern shore. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">[Pg 378]</a></span>
wind blew freshly, and the waves ran high in that quarter;
so it was deemed expedient to lighten the canoe. To this
{196} end Mr. Lee, the two Americans and myself, landed
on the northern shore for a walk, while the Indians should
paddle around to the lower point of the bar. We travelled
along the beach. It was generally hard and gravelly.</p>

<p>Among the pebbles, I noticed several splendid specimens
of the agate. The soil of the flats was a vegetable mould,
eighteen inches or two feet in depth, resting on a stratum
of sand and gravel, and evidently overflown by the annual
floods of June. The flats varied from a few rods to a
mile in width. While enjoying this walk, the two Americans
started up a deer, followed it into the woods, and,
loth to return unsuccessful, pursued it till long after our
canoe was moored below the bar. So that Mr. Lee and
myself had abundant time to amuse ourselves with all
manner of homely wishes towards our persevering companions
till near sunset, when the three barges of Dr.
McLaughlin, under their Indian blanket sails and sapling
masts, swept gallantly by us, and added the last dreg to
our vexation. Mr. Lee was calm, I was furious. What,
for a paltry deer, lose a view of the Columbia hence to the
Fort! But I remember with satisfaction that no one
was materially {197} injured by my wrath, and that my
truant countrymen were sufficiently gratified with their
success to enable them to bear with much resignation,
three emphatic scowls, as they made their appearance
at the canoe.</p>

<p>The dusk of night was now creeping into the valleys,
and we had twenty miles to make. The tide from the
Pacific was setting up, and the wind had left us; but our
Indians suggested that the force of their paddles, stimulated
by a small present of "shmoke" (tobacco,) would
still carry us in by eleven o'clock. We therefore gave<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">[Pg 379]</a></span>
our promises to pay the required quantum of the herb,
ensconced ourselves in blankets, and dozed to the wild
music of the paddles, till a shower of hail aroused us. It
was about ten o'clock. An angry cloud hung over us,
and the rain and hail fell fast; the wind from Mounts
Washington and Jefferson chilled every fibre of our systems;
the wooded hills, on both sides of the river were
wrapped in cold brown clouds; the owl and wolf were
answering each other on the heights; enough of light lay
on the stream to show dimly the islands that divided its
waters, and the fires of the wigwams disclosed the naked
groups of savages around them.</p>

<p>{198} It was a scene that the imagination loves. The
canoe, thirty feet in length, (such another had cut those
waters centuries before); the Indians, kneeling two and two,
and rising on their paddles; their devoted missionary surveying
them and the villages on the shores, and rejoicing
in the anticipation, that soon the songs of the redeemed
savage would break from the dark vales of Oregon; that
those wastes of mind would soon teem with a harvest of
happiness and truth, cast a breathing unutterable charm
over the deep hues of that green wilderness, dimly seen
on that stormy night, which will give me pleasure to dwell
upon while I live. "On the bar!" cried Mr. Lee; and
while our Indians leaped into the water, and dragged
the canoe to the channel, he pointed to the dim light of
the Hudson Bay Company's saw and grist mill two miles
above on the northern shore.</p>

<p>We were three miles from Vancouver. The Indians
knew the bar, and were delighted to find themselves so
near the termination of their toil. They soon found the
channel, and leaping aboard plied their paddles with
renewed energy. And if any one faltered, the steersman
rebuked him with his own hopes of "shmoke" and "sche<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">[Pg 380]</a></span>otecut,"
(the Fort) which never failed {199} to bring
the delinquent to duty. Twenty minutes of vigorous
rowing moored us at the landing. A few hundred yards
below, floated a ship and a sloop, scarcely seen through
the fog. On the shore rose a levee or breastwork, along
which the dusky savages were gliding with stealthy and
silent tread; in the distance were heard voices in English
speaking of home. We landed, ascended the levee,
entered a lane between cultivated fields, walked a quarter
of a mile, where, under a long line of pickets, we entered
Fort Vancouver&mdash;the goal of my wanderings, the destination
of my weary footsteps!<a name="FNanchor_245" id="FNanchor_245"></a><a href="#Footnote_245" class="fnanchor">[245]</a></p>

<p>Mr. James Douglass, the gentleman who had been in
charge of the post during the absence of Dr. McLaughlin,
conducted us to a room warmed by a well-fed stove;
insisted that I should change my wet garments for dry
ones, and proffered every other act that the kindest hospitality
could suggest to relieve me of the discomforts
resulting from four months' journeying in the wilderness.<a name="FNanchor_246" id="FNanchor_246"></a><a href="#Footnote_246" class="fnanchor">[246]</a></p>

relate to reversion to the primitive spirit represented by the clan animal, rather
than to transmigration into living animals. This statement of Farnham's would
appear to have been suggested by totem poles near the graves.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_246" id="Footnote_246"></a><a href="#FNanchor_246"><span class="label">[246]</span></a> Sir James Douglas was born (1803) in British Guiana. Taken to Scotland
when a child, he left in order to enter the Canadian fur-trade, and met Dr. John
McLoughlin at Fort William, on Lake Superior. McLoughlin persuaded the
youth to accompany him to the Pacific, where (1824) he was in service at Fort
St. James under Factor Connelly, whose daughter Douglas married. For some
years he was in charge of Fort St. James, being summoned (1828) to Vancouver,
where he became second in command. Promoted to be chief trader (1830) and
chief factor two years later, he was much employed in visits of inspection and in
building new posts. In 1841-42 he went on a diplomatic and trading embassy
to California. In 1843 Fort Victoria was built under his direction. Upon Dr.
McLoughlin's resignation (1845), Douglas became his successor as head of the
Hudson's Bay Company's interests on the Pacific, removing from Fort Vancouver
to Victoria in 1849. There he continued to rule until his resignation from
the Company (1859), when the British government appointed him governor of
the newly-erected province of British Columbia, an office which he held until
1864, being in the preceding year knighted for his services. After release from
official duties, Sir James visited Europe, returning to his home in Victoria, where
he died August 2, 1877.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p></div></div>
